They offer a perfect primer to the great works of Bach, Beethoven, Britten and beyond for K-8 and 9-12 students&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;with engaging historical anecdotes and simple theory for younger students, and more complex information for older students. Indeed, just about anyone can learn a thing or two from our MTS Future First Listening Guides&thinsp;&hellip;&thinsp;so dig in!</p>

          <p><b>Antonio Vivaldi: Recorder Concerto in C Minor, RV 441</b></p>

          <p>Antonio Vivaldi was a renowned Baroque Italian composer, violinist, and teacher who was born in Venice, Italy in 1678 and died in 1741. Vivaldi, also an ordained priest, served for many years as string teacher, conductor and composer-in-residence at Ospedale della Piet&agrave;, a convent, orphanage, and well-regarded music school in Venice. The Piet&agrave; had exceptionally high musical standards and Vivaldi composed a large body of sacred vocal and instrumental music for the highly talented female music ensembles at Piet&agrave;. Piet&agrave; was financially very well-endowed, since many of the female &ldquo;orphans&rdquo; were actually the illegitimate children of wealthy Italian noblemen and placed there at the request of their fathers.</p>

          <p>Vivaldi is best known for the over 500 concertos he wrote for orchestra and solo instruments.  A group of four Vivaldi violin concerti, each associated with a different season of the year and together known as <i>The Four Seasons</i>, have been made famous over the years in thousands of recordings and as background music for movies and advertisements. Vivaldi also wrote over 40 operas as well as works for choir and a variety of instruments such as oboe, violin, bassoon, cello, flute, and various sizes of recorder.</p>

          <p>Vivaldi&rsquo;s recorder and flute concertos demand players of virtuosic talent.  The solo recorder concertos were likely written for the technically and musically advanced talents of the Piet&agrave; virtuoso musicians and performing ensembles. The Recorder Concerto in C minor RV 441 is known as the most technically demanding of Vivaldi&rsquo;s recorder concertos and as one of the most virtuosic recorder compositions in the entire Baroque recorder repertoire. It is considered a jewel among Vivaldi&rsquo;s mature style concertos.</p>

          </div>

          <p><b>Here are some ways to help you listen to this work:</b></p>

          <span class="badge">1</span> Music compositions have a certain architecture called musical form. Can you hear that the structure of this concerto is made up of three different sections or movements? The Italian composer Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741) was known for writing structures or forms in three fast-slow-fast movements. In this concerto the movements are titled:

          <ol>
            <li>Allegro non molto (fast and lively but not too fast)</li>
            <li>Largo (slowly and broadly)</li>
            <li>Allegro (fast and lively)</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Each of the three sections or movements also has a particular form.  In this concerto, each movement is created in some version of ritornello form. Ritornello form is based on a recurring theme (a refrain called the ritornello) played by the orchestra and interspersed with solo episodes of contrasting or related material played by the soloist(s) or small groups of instruments.  The word ritornello is derived from the Italian word &lsquo;ritornare&rsquo; and is translated as &lsquo;return.&rsquo; </p>

          <p>The ritornello typically is heard as the introduction and then returns after the solo section as an interlude and as a postlude at the end of a movement. However, in this particular concerto, can you hear the recorder join the orchestra in the ritornello that opens the first movement?  And can you hear the recorder join the orchestra in the closing ritornello that concludes the third movement? The interplay and contrasts between the orchestral ritornello and the solo recorder can be heard throughout the concerto and the dialogue between the orchestra and solo recorder is perhaps most distinctly heard in the third movement Allegro. Can you hear the tutti (meaning &lsquo;all&rsquo; or whole orchestra) sections alternate with the solo recorder player in this movement?  The alternation between tutti and solo sections is a common feature of Baroque ritornello concerto form. </p>

          <p><span class="badge">2</span> What <b>instruments</b> can you hear in this concerto? A concerto is a work of music for a solo performer or a small group of solo performers and an orchestra.  In this Concerto, the solo performer is the recorder player. There are different sizes of recorder including sopranino, soprano, alto, tenor, and bass recorders. Can you tell which recorder is being played in this concerto? Typically, this concerto is played by the alto recorder although it has been transposed for other recorders as well as for the flute.</p>

          <p>When do you first hear the recorder? Do you hear the way that Vivaldi focuses on the solo recorder and gives the recorder special parts to play in the concerto? Can you hear the recorder in back and forth dialogue with the orchestra? When the orchestra plays with the solo recorder, can you hear how Vivaldi uses the orchestra as an accompaniment for the soloist? Can you hear when the orchestra plays by itself and when the recorder plays the same parts as the orchestra?</p>

          <p>How many other musicians are playing onstage? What string instruments do you hear (violin, viola, cello, double bass)? Can you hear a harpsichord playing? The harpsichord is part of a group of accompanying instruments that provide harmonic support, known as the <b>Basso continuo</b> or <b>continuo</b> for short. Basso continuo means &quot;continuous bass&quot; and in the Baroque period was often made up of a keyboard instrument and another lower or bass instrument, for example, the cello, double bass, or bassoon. The number and type of instruments in the continuo group varied widely according to Baroque music practices, but always included at least one instrument that could play chords (e.g., harpsichord, organ, lute, harp, or guitar) in combination with a bass register instrument or instruments. </p>

          <p><span class="badge">3</span> Vivaldi uses <b>tempo</b> (the speed of the music), <b>dynamics</b> (the volume of the music), and <b>expression</b> (musical elements that express certain feelings or dispositions) to create contrast and different moods throughout the concerto.</p>

          <p>Can you identify a particular mood for each movement? What kind of mood is created by the energetic dialogue between the solo recorder and the orchestra in the first and third movements? Can you hear a distinct change in mood at the opening melody of the second movement?</p>

          <p>Which movements use mostly fast music?  Which movement uses mostly slow music? Can you hear when the tempo of the music changes and gets faster or slower? How does that affect the mood of the work?</p>

          <p>Was the music played at all the same volume (<b>dynamics</b>)? When do you hear music played loudly? Quietly? What dynamic level is mostly used for the slow second movement? When do the dynamics change and what effect does that create? When does the music get louder (<b>crescendo</b>) or get quieter (<b>decrescendo</b>)?</p>

          <p>Do you hear musical sounds that are short sounding (<b>staccato</b>) or very smooth sounding (<b>legato</b>)?  Where do you hear suddenly loud sounds (<b>accents</b>)?</p>

          <p>Vivaldi also adds expressive qualities to this concerto by the use of ornamentation. Ornamentation was common in the Baroque period and performers would often add certain musical flourishes or decorations to their parts. Ornamentation was also written into parts, as for example, when Vivaldi decorates the melody notes by adding extra very short notes just above or below the main melody note, or by altering rhythms. In the opening of the first movement, can you hear a short, decorative trill-like note called an acciaccatura? Can you hear the bird-like acciaccaturas and trills in the recorder part of the third movement?</p>

          <p><span class="badge">4</span> How is <b>rhythm</b> used in this concerto? Do you hear sections that have a steady rhythm or beat that you could tap to? The underlying steady pulse heard throughout the concerto is a feature of Baroque music.</p>

          <p>The opening movement ritornello begins with a rhythmic pattern of sixteenth and eighth notes that sounds like &ldquo;let me in, let me in, I am knocking, I am knocking.&rdquo; Do you hear that pattern or parts of that pattern again in other parts in the first movement?</p>

          <p>The first solo recorder part in the opening movement features triplet rhythms (three equally spaced notes played in the space of two). Can you hear where the recorder begins playing a running, downwards scalic pattern of triplets? Listen for triplet patterns going upwards and downwards in other places in the first movement.</p>

          <p>This Vivaldi concerto is known as one of the most virtuosic concertos of the Baroque era, due in part to the challenges of the rhythmic and melodic parts. Can you hear where the recorder plays very rapid rhythmic passages in the first movement? Some sections feature the recorder playing notes that are just 1/32 of the duration of a whole note (32nd notes).</p>

          <p>Can you hear how the rhythmic patterns change in the second slow movement? Can you hear notes of longer duration in the second movement of this concerto? Then can you hear a return to sequences of triplet patterns and faster rhythmic passages in the third movement?</p>

          <p><span class="badge">5</span> How is <b>melody</b> or <b>pitch</b> used in this concerto? Vivaldi&rsquo;s melodic writing for the recorder part in this concerto makes this a hugely challenging work for even the most virtuosic of recorder players and is an important reason why this concerto is considered perhaps the most demanding and virtuosic recorder concerto in all the Baroque repertoire! One of the reasons this concerto is so difficult to play is because there are so many large leaps from one melody note to the next, particularly in the rapid, complex rhythmic passages.</p>

          <p>Can you hear places in all three movements where the recorder plays notes that seem to make large leaps up or down to the next note? Can you hear where the melodic patterns for the recorder and the orchestra are contrasting and sound more even, like one note running quickly after another in a scalic pattern? Even the rapid scalic runs of this concerto are considered treacherous by recorder players! Can you draw the shape of these melodies in the air to show when sounds are going up or down?</p>

          <p>In the first movement, can you hear the opening orchestral ritornello melody (refrain) or fragments of this melody repeated again anywhere in the first movement? </p>

          <p>How could you describe the melodies heard in the slower, second movement? Does this melody sound like a processional or march-like to you? Do you hear that the second movement begins with three repeated melody notes? The first two notes are played in the same rhythm and the third note is a shorter note that leads to the same melodic sequence played on higher notes. Do you hear repeated notes anywhere else in the second movement? </p>

          <p>Vivaldi writes many melodic contrasts into the third movement. What different melodic features can you hear in the third movement? Can you hear large melodic leaps? Both very high and very low notes for the recorder?  Ornamented melodic lines?  Fast scalic patterns? Triplet melodic sequences? Rapid arpeggiated passages where the recorder alternates jumping back and forth on different notes of a chord? When you listen to the solo recorder and orchestra instruments can you pick out which instruments play mostly higher notes? Which instruments in the orchestra play lower notes?  </p>

          <p><span class="badge">6</span> Can you hear different kinds of <b>texture</b> in this work? Musical texture refers to the layers of sound that are heard in the music. Where do you hear lots of instruments playing together so that the sound is thick? Where do you hear just a few instruments playing to create sparser sounding texture?</p>

          <p>Can you hear where the texture of this concerto is many-layered with different independent busy lines or voices played by the orchestra and solo musician? This kind of texture is called <b>polyphonic</b> or &lsquo;many voiced.&rsquo;</p>

          <p>Can you hear where the texture of this concerto is not as busy or &ldquo;many-voiced&rdquo; and where the orchestra instruments sounds similar or &ldquo;like sounding&rdquo; and move in the same rhythm rather than as independent melodic lines with their own rhythms and characters? Chords that are like sounding and are used to support a main, independent melody line are known as homophonic in texture. </p>

          <p>Listen for the texture in the second movement. Can you hear that the orchestra does not have as many busy, independent, layered parts but is instead more chordal and <b>homophonic</b>?  </p>

          <p><span class="badge">7</span> What kinds of instrumental <b>timbre</b> do you hear? Timbre is the different qualities of sound created by different instruments. For example the kind of sound that the string instruments make when they play together is a different quality of sound to that produced by brass instruments like the trumpet or French horn. Can you hear how the timbre changes when the harpsichord plays with the strings? When the recorder plays with the strings?</p>

          <p>When does the timbre of the music change because Vivaldi adds or takes away different instruments? Can you hear when the orchestra is playing alone and when the orchestra musicians are playing together with the soloist? Can you hear different qualities of sound depending on what instrument or instruments are playing? Can you tell which instruments are playing just from hearing them? </p>

          <p><b>Concerto pour fl&ucirc;te &agrave; bec en do mineur, RV 441 d&rsquo;Antonio Vivaldi</b> </p>

          <p>Antonio Vivaldi, n&eacute; &agrave; Venise en 1678 et mort &agrave; Vienne en 1741 &eacute;tait un violoniste, professeur et compositeur italien c&eacute;l&egrave;bre de l&rsquo;&eacute;poque baroque. &Eacute;galement ordonn&eacute; pr&ecirc;tre, Vivaldi a servi pendant de nombreuses ann&eacute;es en tant que ma&icirc;tre de violon, chef d&apos;orchestre et compositeur en r&eacute;sidence &agrave; Ospedale della Piet&agrave;, hospice, orphelinat et conservatoire de musique prestigieux de Venise. La Piet&agrave; offrait une &eacute;ducation musicale de tr&egrave;s haut niveau et Vivaldi composa un nombre imposant de pi&egrave;ces sacr&eacute;es, instrumentales et vocales pour les jeunes filles de grand talent de cet orphelinat. La Piet&agrave; &eacute;tait tr&egrave;s bien dot&eacute;e financi&egrave;rement puisque beaucoup des jeunes orphelines &eacute;taient en fait les enfants ill&eacute;gitimes de riches nobles italiens, plac&eacute;es dans cet orphelinat &agrave; la demande de leurs p&egrave;res.</p>

          <p>Vivaldi est r&eacute;put&eacute; pour avoir &eacute;crit plus de 500 concertos pour orchestre et instruments solos. Les quatre concertos pour violon connus sous le nom  &laquo; Les quatre saisons &raquo; sont devenus tr&egrave;s populaires puisqu&rsquo;ils ont &eacute;t&eacute; utilis&eacute;s dans des milliers d&apos;enregistrements et comme musique de films et de publicit&eacute;s. Vivaldi a &eacute;crit plus de 40 op&eacute;ras ainsi que des &oelig;uvres pour ch&oelig;ur et pour une vari&eacute;t&eacute; d&apos;instruments tels que le hautbois, le violon, le basson, le violoncelle, la fl&ucirc;te, et diff&eacute;rentes fl&ucirc;tes &agrave; bec.</p>

          <p>Les concertos de Vivaldi pour fl&ucirc;te traversi&egrave;re et fl&ucirc;te &agrave; bec exigent beaucoup de virtuosit&eacute;. Les solos des concertos pour fl&ucirc;te &agrave; bec ont probablement &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;crits en lien avec le talent technique et musical des instrumentistes virtuoses et des ensembles musicaux de la Piet&agrave;. Le concerto en do mineur RV 441 est reconnu pour son exigence technique et virtuose. Ce concerto est consid&eacute;r&eacute; comme un joyau parmi tous les concertos de Vivaldi.</p>

          <p><b>Voici des suggestions pour vous aider &agrave; &eacute;couter cette &oelig;uvre :</b></p>

          <p><span class="badge">1</span> Les &oelig;uvres musicales poss&egrave;dent une architecture appel&eacute;e forme musicale. Pouvez-vous entendre la structure de ce concerto compos&eacute;e de trois diff&eacute;rents mouvements? Le compositeur italien Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741) &eacute;tait reconnu pour &eacute;crire des formes musicales en trois mouvements vif-lent-vif. Dans ce concerto les mouvements sont:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Allegro non molto (vif, mais pas trop);</li>
          <li>Largo (large, lent);</li>
          <li>Allegro (vif et allègre)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Chaque mouvement a &eacute;galement une forme particuli&egrave;re. Dans ce concerto, Vivaldi utilise une version de la forme ritornello. La forme ritornello est bas&eacute;e sur un th&egrave;me r&eacute;current (un refrain appel&eacute; le ritornello) jou&eacute; par l&apos;orchestre et entrecoup&eacute; de solos jou&eacute;s par le soliste ou par de petits groupes d&apos;instruments. Le mot ritornello est d&eacute;riv&eacute; du mot italien ritornare qui se traduit par &laquo; retour &raquo;. L&apos;alternance entre les tutti et les solos est une caract&eacute;ristique commune de la forme ritornello du concerto baroque.</p>

          <p>Le ritornello est g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement entendu dans l&apos;introduction, puis il revient apr&egrave;s le solo comme un interlude et comme postlude &agrave; la fin du mouvement. Dans ce concerto-ci, pouvez-vous entendre la fl&ucirc;te &agrave; bec jouer avec l&apos;orchestre dans le ritornello au d&eacute;but du premier mouvement? Pouvez-vous &eacute;galement entendre la fl&ucirc;te &agrave; bec jouer avec l&rsquo;orchestre dans le ritornello qui conclut le troisi&egrave;me mouvement? Le jeu et les contrastes entre le ritornello orchestral et celui du solo de la fl&ucirc;te &agrave; bec peuvent &ecirc;tre entendus tout au long du concerto et le dialogue entre l&apos;orchestre et fl&ucirc;te &agrave; bec solo se distingue un peu plus dans le troisi&egrave;me mouvement Allegro. Pouvez-vous entendre le tutti (qui signifie &laquo; tout &raquo; ou &laquo; tout l&rsquo;orchestre &raquo;) qui alterne avec la fl&ucirc;te &agrave; bec solo dans ce mouvement?</p>

          <p><span class="badge">2</span> Quels <b>instruments</b> peut-on entendre dans ce concerto? Un concerto est une &oelig;uvre musicale pour un interpr&egrave;te soliste ou un petit groupe de solistes et un orchestre. Dans ce concerto, le soliste joue la fl&ucirc;te &agrave; bec. Il existe diff&eacute;rentes fl&ucirc;tes &agrave; bec de tailles diff&eacute;rentes&nbsp;: sopranino, soprano, alto, t&eacute;nor et basse. Pouvez-vous dire quelle sorte de fl&ucirc;te &agrave; bec est jou&eacute;e dans ce concerto? Ce concerto est habituellement interpr&eacute;t&eacute; &agrave; la fl&ucirc;te alto m&ecirc;me si elle a &eacute;t&eacute; transpos&eacute;e pour d&rsquo;autres sortes de fl&ucirc;tes &agrave; ainsi que pour la fl&ucirc;te traversi&egrave;re.</p>

          <p>Quand entendez-vous la fl&ucirc;te pour la premi&egrave;re fois dans ce mouvement? Remarquez-vous la fa&ccedil;on dont Vivaldi met l&apos;accent sur les solos de fl&ucirc;te et leur donne une place sp&eacute;ciale dans le concerto? Pouvez-vous entendre la fl&ucirc;te dialoguer avec l&apos;orchestre? Pouvez-vous entendre comment Vivaldi a utilis&eacute; l&rsquo;orchestre pour accompagner le soliste? Pouvez-vous entendre quand l&apos;orchestre joue seul et lorsque la fl&ucirc;te joue les m&ecirc;mes parties que l&apos;orchestre?</p>

          <p>Combien d&rsquo;autres instruments sont jou&eacute;s? Quels instruments &agrave; cordes reconnaissez-vous (violon, alto, violoncelle, contrebasse)? Pouvez-vous entendre le clavecin? Le clavecin fait partie d&apos;un groupe d&apos;instruments qui fait l&rsquo;accompagnement et apporte un soutien harmonique appel&eacute; basso continuo ou continuo. Le basso continuo signifie &laquo; basse continue &raquo; et &agrave; l&apos;&eacute;poque baroque, il &eacute;tait souvent compos&eacute; d&apos;un instrument &agrave; clavier et d&rsquo;une basse ou autre instrument au registre plus grave, par exemple, le violoncelle, la contrebasse, ou le basson. Le nombre et le type d&apos;instruments dans le groupe de continuo variaient beaucoup selon diff&eacute;rentes pratiques en musique baroque, mais incluaient au moins un instrument qui pouvait jouer les accords (par exemple, le clavecin, l&rsquo;orgue, le luth, la harpe ou la guitare) en combinaison avec un instrument au registre plus grave.</p>

          <p><span class="badge">3</span> Vivaldi utilise le <b>tempo</b> (vitesse de la musique), les <b>nuances</b> (volume de la musique), et <b>l&apos;expression</b> (&eacute;l&eacute;ments musicaux qui expriment certains sentiments) pour cr&eacute;er les contrastes et les diff&eacute;rentes atmosph&egrave;res du concerto.</p>

          <p>Pouvez-vous identifier une atmosph&egrave;re particuli&egrave;re pour chaque mouvement du concerto? Quel genre d&rsquo;ambiance est cr&eacute;&eacute; par le dialogue &eacute;nergique entre la fl&ucirc;te solo et l&apos;orchestre dans le premier et le troisi&egrave;me mouvement? Pouvez-vous entendre un changement soudain d&rsquo;atmosph&egrave;re &agrave; l&rsquo;ouverture du deuxi&egrave;me mouvement?</p>

          <p>Quels mouvements ont un tempo plus rapide? Quel mouvement a un tempo plus lent? Pouvez-vous entendre quand le tempo change et devient plus rapide ou plus lent? Comment cela affecte-t-il l&apos;atmosph&egrave;re de l&rsquo;&oelig;uvre?</p>

          <p>La musique a-t-elle &eacute;t&eacute; jou&eacute;e au m&ecirc;me volume (fort, doux, etc.)? Quand entendez-vous la musique jou&eacute;e fortement, doucement? Quelle nuance est principalement utilis&eacute;e dans le deuxi&egrave;me mouvement? Les changements de nuance produisent quelles sortes d&rsquo;effets? Entendez-vous les crescendi ou les decrescendi?</p>

          <p>Entendez-vous les sons secs et courts (staccato)&nbsp;? Entendez-vous les sons li&eacute;s (legato)? Entendez-vous les sons forts soudains (accents)?</p>

          <p>Vivaldi ajoute aussi des qualit&eacute;s expressives au concerto en utilisant des ornements. L&rsquo;ornementation &eacute;tait courante &agrave; l&apos;&eacute;poque baroque et les interpr&egrave;tes ajoutaient certaines fioritures  ou d&eacute;corations musicales &agrave; leurs partitions. Vivaldi orne les notes de la m&eacute;lodie en ajoutant des notes suppl&eacute;mentaires tr&egrave;s courtes juste au-dessus ou en dessous de la note principale de la m&eacute;lodie ou en alt&eacute;rant les rythmes. Au d&eacute;but du premier mouvement, pouvez-vous entendre une note trill&eacute;e appel&eacute; acciaccatura? Pouvez-vous entendre ces trilles et ces acciaccaturas ressemblant aux chants d&rsquo;oiseaux &agrave; la fl&ucirc;te dans le troisi&egrave;me mouvement?</p>

          <p><span class="badge">4</span> Comment le <b>rythme</b> est-il utilis&eacute; dans ce concerto? Entendez-vous les parties de l&rsquo;&oelig;uvre qui ont un rythme r&eacute;gulier ou puls&eacute;? La pulsation continue entendue tout le long du concerto est une caract&eacute;ristique de la musique baroque.</p>

          <p>Le premier ritornello commence par un motif rythmique de croches et de doubles-croches qui ressemble au rythme parl&eacute; suivant&nbsp;: &laquo; Saut&rsquo; ici, saut&rsquo; l&agrave;-bas, cours plus vite, cours plus vite &raquo; Entendez-vous ce motif ou une partie de ce motif dans d&apos;autres parties dans du premier mouvement?</p>

          <p>Le d&eacute;but du solo de fl&ucirc;te du premier mouvement comporte un rythme en triolet (trois notes jou&eacute;es &eacute;galement dans l&apos;espace de deux). Pouvez-vous entendre lorsque la fl&ucirc;te commence &agrave; jouer ces triolets dans un motif m&eacute;lodique descendant? &Eacute;coutez ces motifs de triolet ascendants et descendants &agrave; d&apos;autres endroits dans le premier mouvement.</p>

          <p>Ce concerto de Vivaldi est connu comme l&apos;un des concertos les plus exigeants sur le plan de la virtuosit&eacute; de l&apos;&eacute;poque baroque, d&ucirc; en partie aux d&eacute;fis rythmiques et m&eacute;lodiques. Pouvez-vous entendre o&ugrave; la fl&ucirc;te joue des passages rythmiques tr&egrave;s rapides dans le premier mouvement? Certaines parties de la partition de la fl&ucirc;te sont &eacute;crites en triples croches, soit la valeur de 1/32 d&rsquo;une figure de note ronde.</p>

          <p>Pouvez-vous entendre la fa&ccedil;on dont les motifs rythmiques changent dans le deuxi&egrave;me mouvement? Pouvez-vous entendre des notes de plus longue dur&eacute;e dans ce deuxi&egrave;me mouvement de concerto? Pouvez-vous entendre le retour des motifs de triolet et des passages rythmiques plus rapides dans le troisi&egrave;me mouvement?</p>

          <p><span class="badge">5</span> Comment la <b>m&eacute;lodie</b> est-elle utilis&eacute;e dans ce concerto? Dans ce concerto, l&rsquo;&eacute;criture m&eacute;lodique de Vivaldi pour la fl&ucirc;te en fait une &oelig;uvre extr&ecirc;mement difficile, m&ecirc;me pour le plus grand virtuose. C&rsquo;est la raison pour laquelle ce concerto est consid&eacute;r&eacute; comme un des concertos le plus exigeant sur le plan de la virtuosit&eacute; dans tout le r&eacute;pertoire baroque! Ce concerto est difficile &agrave; jouer parce qu&apos;il y a beaucoup de grands sauts m&eacute;lodiques, en particulier dans les passages rythmiques complexes et rapides.</p>

          <p>Pouvez-vous entendre des endroits dans les trois mouvements o&ugrave; la fl&ucirc;te joue des notes qui semblent faire de grands sauts allant du grave &agrave; l&rsquo;aigu? Pouvez-vous rep&eacute;rer o&ugrave; sont les motifs m&eacute;lodiques pour fl&ucirc;te et orchestre qui contrastent et ressemblent &agrave; des gammes rapides? Ces motifs rapides sont consid&eacute;r&eacute;s tr&egrave;s p&eacute;rilleux par les plus grands interpr&egrave;tes de fl&ucirc;te &agrave; bec! Pouvez-vous dessiner la forme m&eacute;lodique dans les airs quand les sons montent et  descendent? Dans le premier mouvement, pouvez-vous entendre le d&eacute;but orchestral du ritornello (refrain) ou les fragments r&eacute;p&eacute;t&eacute;s de cette m&eacute;lodie tout au long du premier mouvement?</p>

          <p>Comment pourriez-vous d&eacute;crire les m&eacute;lodies entendues dans le deuxi&egrave;me mouvement? Selon vous, est-ce que la m&eacute;lodie ressemble &agrave; une procession ou une marche? Entendez-vous les trois notes r&eacute;p&eacute;t&eacute;es au d&eacute;but du deuxi&egrave;me mouvement? Les deux premi&egrave;res notes sont jou&eacute;es dans le m&ecirc;me rythme et la troisi&egrave;me note est une note plus courte qui conduit &agrave; la m&ecirc;me s&eacute;quence m&eacute;lodique jou&eacute;e dans un registre plus aigu. Entendez-vous des notes r&eacute;p&eacute;t&eacute;es ailleurs dans le deuxi&egrave;me mouvement?</p>

          <p>Vivaldi utilise plusieurs contrastes m&eacute;lodiques dans le troisi&egrave;me mouvement. Quelles sont les caract&eacute;ristiques m&eacute;lodiques perceptibles dans le troisi&egrave;me mouvement? Pouvez-vous entendre de grands sauts m&eacute;lodiques? Les deux notes tr&egrave;s aigu&euml;s et tr&egrave;s graves pour la fl&ucirc;te? Les ornements des lignes m&eacute;lodiques? Les s&eacute;ries de gammes rapides? Les s&eacute;quences de triolets m&eacute;lodiques? Les passages rapides d&rsquo;arp&egrave;ges o&ugrave; la fl&ucirc;te saute d&rsquo;une note &agrave; l&rsquo;autre sur les notes diff&eacute;rentes d&apos;un accord? Lorsque vous &eacute;coutez les solos de fl&ucirc;te et les instruments de l&rsquo;orchestre, pouvez-vous dire quels instruments jouent les notes les plus aigu&euml;s? Quels sont les instruments de l&apos;orchestre qui jouent des notes plus graves?</p>

          <p><span class="badge">6</span> Pouvez-vous entendre diff&eacute;rentes <b>textures</b> musicales dans cette &oelig;uvre musicale? La texture musicale est d&eacute;finie par des couches sonores entendues dans la musique. O&ugrave; entendez-vous plusieurs instruments jouer tous ensemble donnant une texture plus &eacute;paisse? O&ugrave; entendez-vous seulement quelques instruments jouer donnant une texture plus clairsem&eacute;e?</p>

          <p>Pouvez-vous entendre l&agrave; o&ugrave; la texture est compos&eacute;e de diff&eacute;rentes voix ind&eacute;pendantes jou&eacute;es par l&apos;orchestre et l&rsquo;instrument solo? Ce type de texture est appel&eacute; polyphonie ou &laquo; plusieurs voix &raquo;.</p>

          <p>Entendez-vous l&agrave; o&ugrave; la texture de ce concerto a moins de voix et o&ugrave; les instruments de l&rsquo;orchestre sont plus uniformes ou se ressemblent et ont moins de rythmes ou de m&eacute;lodies uniques et ind&eacute;pendants? Les accords qui se ressemblent et qui sont utilis&eacute;s pour soutenir la m&eacute;lodie principale, ind&eacute;pendante d&eacute;finissent l&rsquo;homophonie dans la texture sonore.</p>

          <p>&Eacute;coutez la texture sonore du deuxi&egrave;me mouvement. Pouvez-vous entendre l&apos;orchestre qui a moins de voix ind&eacute;pendantes et qui est homophonique et plut&ocirc;t compos&eacute; d&rsquo;accords?</p>

          <p><span class="badge">7</span> Quels <b>timbres sonores</b> reconnaissez-vous? Le timbre est d&eacute;fini par la qualit&eacute; de son cr&eacute;&eacute;e par diff&eacute;rents instruments. Par exemple, le type de son des instruments &agrave; cordes quand ils jouent ensemble est une qualit&eacute; de son diff&eacute;rente de celle produite par les cuivres comme la trompette ou le cor fran&ccedil;ais. Pouvez-vous entendre la fa&ccedil;on dont le timbre change lorsque le clavecin joue avec les cordes? Lorsque la fl&ucirc;te joue avec les cordes?</p>

          <p>Quand Vivaldi ajoute ou enl&egrave;ve diff&eacute;rents instruments, le timbre de l&rsquo;&oelig;uvre change. Pouvez-vous entendre quand l&apos;orchestre joue seul et quand il joue avec le soliste? Pouvez-vous entendre diff&eacute;rentes qualit&eacute;s de son en fonction l&apos;instrument ou des instruments qui jouent? &Agrave; l&rsquo;&eacute;coute, pouvez-vous reconna&icirc;tre les instruments qui jouent?</p>
