      <p><b>FRANCESCO GEMINIANI: CONCERTO GROSSO OP. 5, NO. 12 IN D MINOR (LA FOLLIA)</b></p>

      <p>
      Francesco Geminiani (1687-1762) was both a brilliant violin virtuoso and a composer of the Baroque period (roughly 1600-1750). Soon after Geminiani moved from his home in Italy to London in 1714, he established himself as a leading violin player, composer and theorist in England. In 1731 Geminiani wrote the famous and still authoritative The Art of Violin Playing.
      </p>
      <p>
      The Concerto Grosso Op. 5, No. 12 is an arrangement of a Violin Sonata written by Geminiani&rsquo;s teacher, Arcangelo Corelli. Corelli published his highly popular twelve Sonatas for Violin and Continuo Op. 5 in 1700. Geminiani arranged all twelve sonatas as concerti grossi between 1726 and 1727. The last sonata is unique in that it is not a traditional sonata, but rather a set of variations on a widely known modal harmonic progression known as &lsquo;La Follia di Spagna&rsquo; or &lsquo;The Folly of Spain.&rsquo; This traditional harmonic progression can be traced to its use in 15th century dances of Spain and Portugal and has served as the source of inspiration for numerous composers. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Geminani&rsquo;s arrangement of &lsquo;La Follia&rsquo; produced a virtuosic and brilliant set of contrasting variations for concerto grosso.

      <b>
        The following questions can help you listen to this work:
      </b>
      </p>

      <span class="badge">1</span> Form in music refers to the musical architecture or the way the music is structured. The Concerto Grosso is a form of baroque music that contrasts a large ensemble called the ripieno with a smaller group of soloists known as the concertino. The word grosso is Italian for &ldquo;big concert&rdquo; and refers to the larger ripieno (or tutti or concerto grosso). 
      Arcangelo Corelli, Geminiani&rsquo;s teacher, was the first composer to use the term Concerto Grosso. Typically, he used the string section as the ripieno group, and featured two violins and a cello in the concertino group. 
      Can you hear that the form of this Concerto Grosso is actually a set of variations on a theme? The original work features 23 variations on the La Follia theme and harmonic progression. 

      The theme is presented at the outset of the work and is played adagio (slowly). You can hear the first variation as it is clearly contrasted to the theme by its faster, quick and lively Allegro tempo. The remaining variations are also easily distinguished by contrasting tempos. The highly contrasting and quick changing variations themselves feature different forms &mdash; can you hear a jig, a march, or an arpeggiated variation? Can you hear musical themes and motives traded between the small and large groups? 

      <p>
      <span class="badge">2</span> What <b>Instruments</b> can you hear in this Concerto Grosso by Geminiani? Can you hear the two contrasting groups of instruments in the <b>concertino</b> and <b>ripieno</b>? Can you hear the interplay between the solo violin and second violin as they play their virtuosic, technically difficult parts? Can you hear the conversations between the solo and tutti groups? Do you also hear a harpsichord that accompanies the groups? A harmony instrument such as a harpsichord, lute, or organ along with a bass melody instrument such as cello was known in Geminiani&rsquo;s time as a <b>continuo</b>. 
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">3</span> How does Geminiani use <b>expressive elements</b> (musical elements that express certain feelings or dispositions), varying <b>tempos</b> (the speed of the music), and <b>Dynamics</b> (the volume of the music) to create interest and excitement? What <b>tempos</b> (the speed of the music) can you identify in this work? Can you hear a slow tempo at the beginning of the concerto gross followed by a more energetic Allegro (fast and lively)? Can you hear other contrasting tempos throughout the variations? 
      </p>

      <p>
      Does the overture begin with loud or quiet dynamics? Is the music played at all the same volume (dynamics)? When do you hear music played loudly? Quietly? When do the dynamics change and what effect does that create? When does the music get louder (crescendo) or get quieter (decrescendo)? Can you hear an exciting crescendo in the last variation that leads to the finale of the work?
      </p>

      <p>
      What is the overall mood of this concerto grosso and how does Geminiani achieve this mood? Do you hear the contrasts between the serious, stately mood at the beginning and the light-hearted, playful qualities of the following Allegro? How does Geminiani achieve the contrasts of mood heard throughout the Concerto Grosso?  
      </p>

      <p>
      Do you hear musical sounds that are short sounding (staccato) or very smooth sounding (legato)? Do you hear ornamented sounds such as trills that are typical of this period of music writing?
      </p>

      <p>
      How does Geminiani use expressive elements to create character changes in this virtuosic and brilliant set of variations? Can you hear changes from solemn to animated to serene? 
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">4</span> How is <b>rhythm</b> used in this concerto grosso? Do you hear sections that have a steady rhythm or beat that you could tap to? Did any particular rhythmic pattern stand out for you that you could listen for in the work? Can you identify the rhythmic pattern of the opening theme heard and varied throughout the concerto grosso? Can you hear that the opening theme makes use of a dotted note pattern (long then short sound)?  
      </p>

      <p>
      The opening theme is in &frac34; time with three beats to a measure. Can you hear that the pulse or beat of the opening theme can be counted in threes? The opening bar is a quarter note followed by a dotted quarter note and eighth note. The second bar is made up of a half note followed by a quarter note. These patterns are featured in the opening theme and varied throughout the work.  
      </p>


      <p>
      <span class="badge">5</span> How is <b>melody</b> or <b>pitch</b> used in this Concerto Grosso? Can you hear how the melody of the opening solemn theme is repeated, combined, and varied in different ways throughout the Concerto Grosso? The &ldquo;La Follia&rdquo; melody is known as a very catchy tune &mdash; can you hum this melody? 
      </p>

      <p>
      Do you hear the opening two repeated notes in the theme? Do you hear that the opening two repeated notes are followed by one note higher and then a skip down to a note that is also repeated? Do you hear that the opening two repeated notes are heard again but with a trill ornamentation? 
      </p>

      <p>
      Where do you melody notes repeated or moving up or down in scale like patterns throughout the concerto grosso? Can you hear when melody notes skip higher or lower in pitch? 
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">6</span> Can you hear different kinds of <b>texture</b> in this work produced by the two different groups of instruments, concertino and ripieno? Where do you hear all the instruments playing together so that the sound is thick? 
      </p>

      <p>
      Where do you hear a thinner texture where just a few instruments playing or taking turns? Can you tell which instruments are playing?
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">7</span> What kinds of instrumental <b>timbre</b> do you hear? Timbre is the different qualities of sound that can be heard, for example the kinds of sounds that the string instruments make when they play together. When does the timbre of the music change because certain instruments are added or taken away? How is the timbre of the ripieno contrasted to the timbre of the instruments in the concertino?

        ANTONIO VIVALDI: CONCERTO FOR LUTE IN D MAJOR (RV93) ARRANGED FOR GUITAR
      </b>
      </p>

      <p>
      Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741) was a highly prolific Italian composer of the Baroque period (roughly 1600-1750). He wrote choral music, opera, church music, music for a variety of instruments including the lute, and was renowned for his over 500 instrumental concertos. His famous set of concertos, <i>The Four Seasons</i>, has been heard around the world in concert halls, films, advertisements, and arrangements. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Vivaldi&rsquo;s concertos were innovative in their clarity of form (typically three movement), harmonic treatment, and rhythmic and melodic vitality. The Lute Concerto in D major (RV93) was written in the 1730s and is one of four lute works written by Vivaldi. The lute was an important instrument in the 16th and 17th century and like the guitar, is a plucked stringed instruments. The lute and guitar are similar in sound qualities and construction, although the lute has a pear shaped body and more strings. The modern guitar was not invented in Vivaldi&rsquo;s time; however, this chamber concerto is often now performed by guitar as in this performance by soloist Sharon Isbin.

      <b>
        The following questions can help you listen to this work:
      </b>
      </p>

      <span class="badge">1</span> <b>Form</b> in music refers to the musical architecture or the way the music is structured. The Lute Concert in D Major follows Vivaldi&rsquo;s typical fast slow fast three-movement form for concertos. Can you hear that this work is in three large sections or movements called:

      <ol>
        <li>Allegro (lively and quick)</li>
        <li>Largo (very slow)</li>
        <li>Allegro (lively and quick)</li>
      </ol>

      <P>
      Each of the three sections has its own form or structure. The first movement features <b>ritornello</b> form. Ritornello means &ldquo;returning&rdquo; and refers to an instrumental section of music repeated throughout the concerto. The ritornello is a structuring device that serves a variety of functions. Ritornello form highlights the contrasting soloist sections and provides unity as recurring thematic material is played by the larger tutti ensemble. The ritornello also serves to reinforce the main key following modulations featured in the solo sections that contrast with the orchestral ritornello. 
      </P>

      <p>
      Can you hear that the opening and closing ritornello of the first movement includes both the large ensemble and the solo guitar? In between the opening and closing ritornellos, the whole orchestra (tutti) ritornello alternates with sections played by the solist and continuo. In total, it is possible to count 11 different sections in this movement. 
      </p>

      <p>
      The opening ritornello features two contrasting themes, one in major and a second, lyrical theme in a minor key. Can you hear the difference between these two themes? These themes are heard varied throughout the 11 different sections of this movement. 
      </p>

      <p>
      The slow second movement is not a ritornello form but it is in different sections: an A A B A (same, same, different, same) form that features the lyric melodies of the lute played against a string accompaniment.
      </p>

      <p>
      The final third allegro movement, lighter and more playful than the first movement, is in a lively 6/8 time signature that has a dance quality feeling of a tarantella, a fast, whirling Italian folk dance. This movement also features alternating, contrasting tutti chamber orchestra, solo guitar and continuo sections. 
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">2</span> What <b>Instruments</b> can you hear in this Lute Concerto by Vivaldi? Can you hear the guitar contrasted with the tutti (all instruments played together) thematic ritornello sections? Can you hear the conversations between the solo and tutti groups? Do you also hear a harpsichord that accompanies the lute? A harmony instrument such as a harpsichord or organ along with a bass melody instrument was known in Vivaldi&rsquo;s time as the <b>continuo</b>. 
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">3</span> How does Vivaldi use <b>expressive elements</b> (musical elements that express certain feelings or dispositions), varying <b>tempos</b> (the speed of the music), and <b>Dynamics</b> (the volume of the music) to create interest and excitement? What <b>tempos</b> (the speed of the music) can you identify in this work? Do you hear fast tempos in the first and third movements? 
      </p>

      <p>
      Do you hear contrasting slow tempos in the second movement? Can you hear how the slower tempo of the second movement allows the guitar to show off technical skill using ornamented and decorated notes?
      </p>

      <p>
      Does the concerto begin with loud or quiet dynamics (volume of sound)? How does Vivaldi feature the quieter sounds of the guitar? Can you hear how Vivaldi uses different dynamic levels for different parts, for example loud (forte) for the tutti (whole orchestra) and quiet (piano) for the guitar? 
      </p>

      <p>
      Can you hear how the dynamics change frequently throughout the first movement? When do you hear music played loudly? Quietly? When do the dynamics change and what effect does that create? When does the music get louder (crescendo) or get quieter (decrescendo)?  
      </p>

      <p>
      Can you hear how the dynamics are quieter overall in the second movement? Can you hear how the chamber orchestra is given a quieter accompanying role in this movement?
      </p>

      <p>
      Do you hear the mood contrasts between the joyful first movement, the reflective sounds of the second movement, and the playful dance-like third movement?
      </p>

      <p>
      Do you hear musical sounds that are short sounding (staccato) or very smooth sounding (legato)? Do you hear the long, sustained legato sounds of the strings that accompany the guitar in the second movement? Do you hear the sounds of plucked lower strings (pizzicato) in this accompaniment part? Do you hear ornamented sounds in the guitar part such as trills that are typical of this period of music writing?
      </p>

      <P>
      <span class="badge">4</span> How is <b>rhythm</b> used in this lute concerto? Do you hear sections that have a steady rhythm or beat that you could tap to? Did any particular rhythmic pattern stand out for you that you could listen for in the work? Can you hear the first movement opening three note scalic rhythmic pattern that sounds almost like a bird call in the quickly ornamented sounds? Then after two &ldquo;bird calls&rdquo; can you hear four notes repeated in the same rhythm? Can you hear the decorated bird call rhythms anywhere else in the first movement? Can you hear that the second theme of the opening ritornello has more even rhythms? 
      </P>

      <p>
      Can you hear the use of dotted rhythms featured in the second movement that give a rocking quality to this section? Can you hear longer held rhythms in the accompaniment part? Do you hear the fast rhythms that create rhythmic vitality in the third movement?
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">5</span> How is <b>melody</b> or <b>pitch</b> used in this Lute Concerto? 
      </p>

      <p>
      Do you hear the opening two stepwise three note &ldquo;bird call&rdquo; motifs in the first movement followed by repeated melodic notes? Can you hear those melodic patterns elsewhere in the first movement? Can you hear that Vivaldi likes to use concise melodic and rhythmic themes? 
      </p>

      <p>
      Can you hear a contrasting melody played with a quieter dynamic that includes a chromatic (moving by semitones) passage?  
      </p>

      <p>
      Where do you melody notes repeated or moving up or down in scale like patterns throughout the concerto? Can you hear when melody notes skip higher or lower in pitch? Can you hear when the melody is ornamented or decorated by the guitar? 
      </p>

      <P>
      <span class="badge">6</span> Can you hear different kinds of <b>texture</b> in this work produced by the two different groups of instruments &mdash; soloist and tutti orchestra? Where do you hear all the instruments playing together so that the sound is thick? Can you hear the thick, chordal (homophonic) sounds of the tutti parts in the first and third movements?
      </P>

      <p>
      Where do you hear a contrasting thinner texture where just the soloist and simple accompaniment of the continuo are playing?  
      </p>

      <p>
      Can you hear how there is less contrast of texture in the second movement? In this movement the texture is generally thinner with a simple quiet strings accompaniment throughout allowing the guitar to sound above the accompaniment. 
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">7</span> What kinds of instrumental <b>timbre</b> do you hear? Timbre is the different qualities of sound that can be heard, for example the kinds of sounds that the string instruments make when they play together. When does the timbre of the music change because certain instruments are added or taken away? How is the timbre of the tutti contrasted to the timbre of the guitar?

        HOWARD SHORE: BILLY&rsquo;S THEME<br>AARON JAY KERNIS: MUSICA CELESTIS<br>GERALD BARRY: LA JALOUSIE TACITURNE 
      </b>
      </p>

      These three twentieth century works each capture very different but powerful emotional qualities. <i>Billy&rsquo;s Theme</i> by Howard Shore, featuring guitar and orchestral accompaniment, illustrates the feelings of an undercover police agent named Billy Costigan. <i>Musica Celestis</i>, by Aaron Jay Kernis, is inspired by medieval references to the singing of angels, and <i>La Jalousie Taciturne</i> by Gerald Barry is a title taken from a Couperin harpsichord suite and refers to different forms of &ldquo;taciturn jealousy.&rdquo; 

      <p>
      When you listen to <i>Billy&rsquo;s Theme</i> consider:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>How does the repeated opening rhythm and the repeated melody note capture the tormented qualities of the film&rsquo;s character?</li>
        <li>How does melodic and rhythmic treatment in the guitar solo express struggle, doubt, and desperation?</li>
        <li>How does the lyric quality of the guitar&rsquo;s melodic treatment capture elements of that film&rsquo;s character?</li>
        <li>How does the orchestral background and ostinato (repeated pattern) effect create tension in this music?</li>
        <li>How is increased tension and despair created in the music towards the end of this piece? How does the orchestra accompaniment playing alone at the end of this work contribute to the feeling of despair?</li>
