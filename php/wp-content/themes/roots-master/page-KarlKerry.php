						<strong>Karl Stobbe</strong> is recognized as one of Canada&rsquo;s most accomplished violinists, noted for his generous, rich sound, and long, poignant phrasing. As a concertmaster, soloist, chamber musician, and recording musician he has long been an audience favourite. London&rsquo;s <em>Sunday Times</em> calls Karl &ldquo;a master soloist, recalling the golden age of violin playing&thinsp;&hellip;&thinsp;producing a breathtaking range of tone colours.&rdquo; 
					</p>
					<p>
						Violinist <strong>Kerry DuWors</strong> has earned accolades for her &ldquo;poise and maturity&rdquo; and &ldquo;spellbinding expression,&rdquo; and has been praised for always finding &ldquo;the music behind the notes&rdquo; (<em>Winnipeg Free Press</em>). Winner of the 26th Eckhardt-Gramatt&eacute; Competition, she is a dedicated mentor and teacher and is Associate Professor of Violin and Chamber Music at Brandon University. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Both Karl and Kerry have performed in some of North America&rsquo;s most famous concert halls, including New York&rsquo;s Carnegie Hall and Boston&rsquo;s Jordan Hall.
