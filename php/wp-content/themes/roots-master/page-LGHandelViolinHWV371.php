            <p><b>GEORGE FRIDERIC HANDEL: VIOLIN SONATA IN D MAJOR HWV 371</b></p>

            <p>Mystery surrounds the violin sonatas written by the Baroque composer George Frideric Handel (1685-1759). In recent years, musicologists have questioned the origin of some violin sonatas attributed to Handel. Experts from around the world, however, have authenticated Handel&rsquo;s Sonata in D major HWV 371; his Sonata in D major manuscript dating from around 1750 still survives today. But even this authenticated sonata has been associated with intrigue and uncertainty, as it can also be found in pirated publications and with falsified title pages. The Violin Sonata HWV 371 known as the &ldquo;Great D major&rdquo; is considered a masterpiece in the solo violin genre and is one of Handel&rsquo;s last violin sonatas, never published in his lifetime.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Here are some ways to help you listen to this work:</p>

            <p>Music compositions have a certain architecture called musical <b>form</b>. Can you hear that the structure of this sonata is made up of four different sections or movements? In the classical period, the term sonata referred to a particular kind of musical form, but the word <i>sonata</i> as used during Handel&rsquo;s time described almost any kind of composition written for an instrumental ensemble.</p>

            <p>A Baroque instrumental work in three or more movements that included stylized dance movements (e.g., allemande, sarabande, gigue, gavotte, etc.) was known as a &ldquo;Sonata da camera.&rdquo; An instrumental work in four movements often in the order of slow-fast-slow-fast was known as a &ldquo;sonata da chiesa.&rdquo; The Handel Sonata in D major takes the form of a &ldquo;Sonata da chiesa&rdquo; with the following four movements:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Affectuoso (with feeling,tenderly)</li>
              <li>Allegro (lively, fast)</li>
              <li>Larghetto (somewhat slowly)</li>
              <li>Allegro (lively, fast)</li>
            </ol>

            <p><span class="badge">1</span> Each of the four sections or movements also has a particular form. In this sonata, the first movement resembles a slow operatic aria. Can you hear the expressive, singing melodies? The following Allegro is written in a fugal, contrapuntal style. Can you hear the opening melody introduced in the violin then repeated 5 bars later in the keyboard part? The third slow Larghetto movement is also in the form of a dramatic operatic aria and the closing Allegro movement is in the style of a two-part (AB&mdash;binary form) lively dance in 3/4 time.</p>

            <p><span class="badge">2</span> What <b>instruments</b> can you hear in this sonata? In the Baroque time, this sonata would have been performed with a solo instrument and a &ldquo;basso continuo.&rdquo; The &ldquo;basso continuo&rdquo; or &ldquo;continuo&rdquo; for short, was the group of accompanying instruments that provided harmonic support for the solo melody. Basso continuo means &quot;continuous bass&quot; and in the Baroque period was often made up of a keyboard instrument (e.g., harpsichord or organ) that filled in harmonies on top of a bass line played by another lower or bass instrument, such as the cello, viola da gamba, double bass, or bassoon. The number and type of instruments in the continuo group varied widely according to Baroque music practices, but always included at least one instrument that could play chords (e.g., harpsichord, organ, lute, harp, or guitar) in combination with a bass register instrument or instruments.</p>

            <p>In performances today, the keyboard sometimes plays all the parts of the basso continuo. In this performance, how many musicians are playing onstage? Do you hear a piano or a harpsichord playing the keyboard part? Is the keyboard playing alone or do you also hear a bass line performed by a cello or bass? Do you hear the solo violin playing above the accompanying continuo?</p>

            <p><span class="badge">3</span> Handel uses <b>tempo</b> (the speed of the music), <b>dynamics</b> (the volume of the music), and <b>expression</b> (musical elements that express certain feelings or dispositions) to create contrast between the sections of the sonata. Contrast as a dramatic element was an important feature of Baroque music. Where do you hear contrasts of tempo (slow, fast, slow, fast) and contrasts of dynamics in this work?</p>

            <p>A single mood or expressive idea is often associated with Baroque music. Can you identify a particular mood for each movement? Which movements use mostly fast music? Which movement uses mostly slow music? How does the tempo affect the mood of the work?</p>

            <p>Was the music played at all the same volume (<b> dynamics</b>)? When do you hear music played loudly? Quietly? What dynamic level is mostly used for the slow second movement? When do the dynamics change and what effect does that create? Can you hear places where the violin plays the same or similar phrase a second time but either louder or softer in an echo effect?</p>

            <p>Do you hear musical sounds that are short sounding (<b>staccato</b>) or very smooth sounding (<b>legato</b>)?</p>

            <p>Handel also adds expressive qualities to this sonata by the use of ornamentation. Ornamentation was common in the Baroque period and performers would often add certain musical flourishes or decorations to their parts. Ornamentation was also written into parts, as for example, when Handel decorates the melody notes by adding trills. In the opening of the first movement, can you hear short, decorative trills in the violin part?</p>

            <p><span class="badge">4</span> How is <b>rhythm</b> used in this sonata? Do you hear sections that have a steady rhythm or beat that you could tap to? The underlying steady pulse heard throughout the sonata is a feature of Baroque music.</p>

            <p>Handel uses dotted notes (long-short sounds) at various points in this sonata. Can you hear long-short-long-short sounds in the opening of the first movement and throughout this section? Can you hear these dotted rhythms again in the third, slow movement and at the opening of the fourth movement?</p>

            <p>Can you hear notes of longer duration in the first and third movements of this sonata? Can you hear how the rhythmic patterns change in the second and fourth movements? Can you hear where the violin plays rapid rhythmic passages in the fourth movement? The quick sixteenth note runs together with the dotted notes give this movement a sense of lively, positive energy.</p>

            <p><span class="badge">5</span> How is <b>melody</b> or <b>pitch</b> used in this sonata? Can you hear the upward skipping melodic outline of the first movement of the main theme?  The violin begins with a melody that outlines an upward broken triad that then unexpectedly leaps up a fifth instead of the more expected sounding fourth to complete the notes of the opening chord. This creates a surprising and dramatic sounding opening to the sonata. A similar figure of skips and leaps is heard throughout the first movement balanced with a downwards stepwise, dotted rhythm, melodic pattern. Can you draw the shape of these melodies in the air to show when sounds are going up or down?</p>

            <p>In the second movement can you hear that the melodic contour of the solo violin is often made up of back and forth alternating notes? Can you identify melodic patterns in the third and fourth movements?</p>

            <p>Handel often borrowed melodies from one of his works to use in another. Handel reused the last movement of the Sonata in D major for the appearance of the angel in his oratorio &ldquo;Jephtha.&rdquo; &ldquo;Solomon,&rdquo; another oratorio by Handel also shares music with the Violin Sonata in D major. The fugal melody heard in the second movement of the sonata is also heard in the opening act of &ldquo;Solomon as a choral double fugue.</p>

            <p><span class="badge">6</span> Can you hear different kinds of <b>texture</b> in this work? Musical texture refers to the layers of sound that are heard in the music.</p>

            <p>Can you hear where the texture of this sonata features independent lines or voices played by the solo musician and in the accompaniment? Two or more voices played simultaneously each with their own independent melody is known as polyphonic texture. The second movement features polyphonic writing that is also fugal. In a fugue, the main theme is introduced at the beginning of a work and then heard in subsequent imitation by the other voices or lines. Can you hear the opening melody introduced in the violin then repeated 5 bars later in the keyboard part?</p>

            <p>Can you hear where the texture of this sonata is not simultaneous lines of independent melody but is rather texture made up of just one main melodic voice in the violin accompanied by chords? Co you hear that this accompaniment sounds similar or &ldquo;like sounding&rdquo; and that the music of the accompaniment all moves in the same rhythm rather than as independent melodic lines with their own rhythms? Chords that are like sounding and used to support a main, independent melody line are known as <b>homophonic</b> in texture.</p>

            <p>Listen for the texture in other movements. Can you hear that the accompaniment in the first and third movements does not have independent lines as in the second movement but is instead more chordal and homophonic?</p>

            <p><span class="badge">7</span> What kinds of instrumental <b>timbre</b> do you hear? Timbre is the different qualities of sound created by different instruments. For example the kind of sound that string instruments make when they play together is a different quality of sound to that produced by brass instruments like the trumpet or French horn. How would you describe the timbre of the violin? Of the harpsichord or piano? Of the keyboard playing with the violin? Can you hear different qualities of sound depending on what instrument or instruments are playing? Can you tell which instruments are playing just from hearing them?</p>

          <p><b>Sonate en R&eacute; majeur HWV&thinsp;371 pour violon et basse continue de George Friedrich Haendel</b></p>

          <p>Un myst&egrave;re entoure les sonates pour violon de Georg Friedrich Haendel (1685-1759). Depuis quelques ann&eacute;es, les musicologues se sont interrog&eacute;s au sujet de l&rsquo;origine des sonates de violon attribu&eacute;es &agrave; Haendel. N&eacute;anmoins, les experts ont authentifi&eacute; cette sonate en R&eacute; majeur HWV 371 d&rsquo;Haendel. M&ecirc;me associ&eacute;e &agrave; une certaine incertitude, cette sonate authentifi&eacute;e pourrait &eacute;galement &ecirc;tre trouv&eacute;e dans des publications pirat&eacute;es et des titres de pages falsifi&eacute;s. La sonate en R&eacute; majeur HWV 371 est consid&eacute;r&eacute;e comme un chef d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre dans son genre et est une des derni&egrave;res sonates pour violon &eacute;crites par Haendel, jamais publi&eacute;e de son vivant.</p>

          <p>Voici des suggestions pour vous aider &agrave; &eacute;couter cette &oelig;uvre :</p>

          <p><span class="badge">1</span> Les &oelig;uvres musicales poss&egrave;dent une architecture appel&eacute;e <b>forme</b> musicale.</p>

          <p>Pouvez-vous entendre la structure de cette sonate compos&eacute;e de quatre diff&eacute;rents mouvements? Dans la p&eacute;riode classique, le terme sonate faisait r&eacute;f&eacute;rence &agrave; un type particulier de la forme musicale, mais le mot sonate utilis&eacute; &agrave; l&rsquo;&eacute;poque d&rsquo;Haendel d&eacute;crit presque n&rsquo;importe quel type de composition &eacute;crite pour un ensemble instrumental.</p>

          <p>La &laquo; sonata da camera&raquo; est une &oelig;uvre baroque instrumentale compos&eacute;e de plusieurs mouvements incluant des mouvements de danse (p. ex.&nbsp;: l&rsquo;allemande, la sarabande, la gigue, la gavotte, etc.). La &laquo; sonata da chiesa &raquo; comporte g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement quatre mouvements structur&eacute;s dans cet ordre&nbsp;: lent-rapide-lent-rapide. La sonate en R&eacute; majeur de Haendel est une &laquo; sonata da chiesa &raquo; comprenant les quatre mouvements suivants :</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Affectuoso (avec &eacute;motion, tendrement)</li>
            <li>Allegro (enjou&eacute;, rapide)</li>
            <li>Larghetto (plut&ocirc;t lent)</li>
            <li>Allegro (enjou&eacute;, rapide)</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Chaque mouvement poss&egrave;de &eacute;galement une forme particuli&egrave;re. Dans cette sonate, le premier mouvement ressemble &agrave; un air d&apos;op&eacute;ra au tempo lent. Pouvez-vous entendre les m&eacute;lodies chantantes et expressives? L&rsquo;Allegro qui suit, est &eacute;crit dans un style contrapuntique fugu&eacute;. Pouvez-vous entendre la m&eacute;lodie du d&eacute;but jou&eacute;e par le violon puis r&eacute;p&eacute;t&eacute;e cinq mesures plus tard par le piano? Le troisi&egrave;me mouvement Larghetto prend &eacute;galement la forme d&apos;un air dramatique d&apos;op&eacute;ra et le dernier mouvement Allegro est une danse anim&eacute;e en 3/4 en deux parties (forme AB-binaire).</p>

          <p><span class="badge">2</span> Quels <b>instruments</b> peut-on entendre dans cette sonate?</p>

          <p>A l&apos;&eacute;poque baroque, cette sonate aurait &eacute;t&eacute; jou&eacute;e par un instrument solo et une &laquo; basso continuo &raquo;. Le &laquo; basso continuo &raquo; ou &laquo; continuo &raquo;, est le groupe d&apos;instruments d&apos;accompagnement qui soutient harmoniquement la m&eacute;lodie. Le basso continuo signifie &laquo; basse continue &raquo; et &agrave; l&apos;&eacute;poque baroque, il &eacute;tait souvent compos&eacute; d&apos;un clavier et d&rsquo;une basse ou autre instrument au registre plus grave, par exemple, le violoncelle, la contrebasse, ou le basson. Le nombre et le type d&apos;instruments dans le groupe de continuo variait beaucoup selon diff&eacute;rentes pratiques en musique baroque, mais incluait au moins un instrument qui pouvait jouer les accords (par exemple, le clavecin, l&rsquo;orgue, le luth, la harpe ou la guitare) en combinaison avec un instrument au registre plus grave.</p>

          <p>Aujourd&apos;hui, le clavier joue parfois toutes les parties du &laquo; basso continuo &raquo;. Combien comptez-vous de musiciens sur sc&egrave;ne dans ce concert? Quel instrument joue le r&ocirc;le du clavier&nbsp;: un piano ou un clavecin? Est-ce que le clavier joue seul ou est-il accompagn&eacute; d&rsquo;un violoncelle ou d&rsquo;une autre basse? Entendez-vous le violon jouant avec le &laquo; continuo &raquo; qui l&rsquo;accompagne?</p>

          <p><span class="badge">3</span> Haendel utilise le <b>tempo</b> (vitesse de la musique), les <b>nuances</b> (volume de la musique), et l&apos;<b>expression</b> (&eacute;l&eacute;ments musicaux qui expriment certains sentiments) pour cr&eacute;er les contrastes et les diff&eacute;rentes atmosph&egrave;res de la sonate.</p>

          <p>Le contraste est un &eacute;l&eacute;ment dramatique et une caract&eacute;ristique importante de la musique baroque. &Agrave; quel endroit entendez-vous les changements de tempo (lent, rapide, lent, rapide) et les changements de nuances dans cette &oelig;uvre? Une seule atmosph&egrave;re ou une id&eacute;e expressive unique est souvent associ&eacute;e &agrave; la musique baroque. Pouvez-vous identifier l&rsquo;atmosph&egrave;re particuli&egrave;re pour chacun des mouvements de la sonate? Quel mouvement adopte principalement le tempo lent? Comment le tempo affecte-t-il l&apos;atmosph&egrave;re de l&rsquo;&oelig;uvre?</p>

          <p>La musique a-t-elle &eacute;t&eacute; jou&eacute;e avec un volume uniforme (fort, doux, etc.)? Quand entendez-vous les sons forts, les sons doux? Quelle nuance est la plus utilis&eacute;e dans le deuxi&egrave;me mouvement? &Agrave; quel moment y a-t-il un changement de nuances et quel effet cela cr&eacute;e-t-il?</p>

          <p>Entendez-vous les sons secs et courts (staccato)? Entendez-vous les sons li&eacute;s (legato)?</p>

          <p>Haendel ajoute aussi des qualit&eacute;s expressives &agrave; la sonate en utilisant des ornements. L&rsquo;ornementation &eacute;tait courante &agrave; l&apos;&eacute;poque baroque et les interpr&egrave;tes ajoutaient certaines fioritures ou d&eacute;corations musicales &agrave; leurs partitions. Par exemple, Haendel ajoute des trilles pour orner les notes de la m&eacute;lodie. Au d&eacute;but du premier mouvement, pouvez-vous entendre ces trilles jou&eacute;s par le violon?</p>

          <p><span class="badge">4</span> Comment le <b>rythme</b> est-il utilis&eacute; dans cette sonate? </p>

          <p>Entendez-vous les parties de l&rsquo;&oelig;uvre qui ont un rythme puls&eacute;? Le rythme puls&eacute; continu entendu tout le long de la sonate est une caract&eacute;ristique de la musique baroque.</p>

          <p>Pouvez-vous entendre des notes de plus longue dur&eacute;e dans les premier et troisi&egrave;me mouvements de cette sonate? Pouvez-vous entendre la fa&ccedil;on dont les motifs rythmiques changent dans les deuxi&egrave;me et quatri&egrave;me mouvements de la sonate? Les double-croches rapides et les notes point&eacute;es donnent &agrave; ce mouvement une &eacute;nergie vive et positive.</p>

          <p><span class="badge">5</span> Comment la <b>m&eacute;lodie</b> est-elle utilis&eacute;e dans cette sonate?</p>

          <p>Pouvez-vous entendre le contour m&eacute;lodique de sons sautill&eacute;s ascendants du th&egrave;me principal du premier mouvement? Le violon commence avec une m&eacute;lodie compos&eacute;e d&rsquo;un accord bris&eacute; ascendant qui finit de fa&ccedil;on inattendue avec une quinte plut&ocirc;t qu&rsquo;avec une quarte. Cela cr&eacute;e un effet surprenant et spectaculaire d&egrave;s le d&eacute;but de la sonate. Un motif similaire de sauts m&eacute;lodiques ascendants et descendants et de rythmes point&eacute;s est entendu tout au long du premier mouvement. Pouvez-vous dessiner le contour m&eacute;lodique de ce th&egrave;me pour indiquer les sons ascendants et descendants?</p>

          <p>Dans le deuxi&egrave;me mouvement, vous pouvez entendre le violon jouer un motif m&eacute;lodique de notes qui alternent d&rsquo;une &agrave; l&rsquo;autre? Pouvez-vous identifier d&rsquo;autres motifs m&eacute;lodiques dans les troisi&egrave;me et quatri&egrave;me mouvements?</p>

          <p>Haendel a souvent emprunt&eacute; des m&eacute;lodies d&apos;une de ses &oelig;uvres pour l&rsquo;utiliser dans une autre. Haendel a r&eacute;utilis&eacute; le dernier mouvement de la Sonate en R&eacute; majeur dans son oratorio Jepht&eacute;. La sonate en R&eacute; majeur peut &ecirc;tre reconnue dans l&rsquo;oratorio Salomon. La m&eacute;lodie fugu&eacute;e entendue dans le deuxi&egrave;me mouvement de la sonate est &eacute;galement entendu dans l&apos;ouverture de Salomon.</p>

          <p><span class="badge">6</span> Pouvez-vous entendre diff&eacute;rentes <b>textures</b> musicales dans cette &oelig;uvre musicale?</p>

          <p>La texture musicale est d&eacute;finie par des couches sonores entendues dans la musique. Pouvez-vous entendre la texture sonore de cette sonate pr&eacute;sentant des voix ind&eacute;pendantes jou&eacute;es par le violon et le piano? Deux ou plusieurs voix jou&eacute;es simultan&eacute;ment avec leur propre m&eacute;lodie ind&eacute;pendante est d&eacute;crite comme une texture polyphonique. Le deuxi&egrave;me mouvement est caract&eacute;ris&eacute; d&rsquo;une &eacute;criture polyphonique fugu&eacute;e. Dans une fugue, le th&egrave;me principal apparait au d&eacute;but de l&rsquo;&oelig;uvre et est ensuite reproduit dans d&rsquo;autres voix. Pouvez-vous entendre la m&eacute;lodie jou&eacute;e par le violon et r&eacute;p&eacute;t&eacute;e 5 mesures plus tard par le piano ou le clavecin?</p>

          <p>Entendez-vous o&ugrave; la texture de cette sonate n&rsquo;est pas compos&eacute;e de voix ind&eacute;pendantes, mais plut&ocirc;t compos&eacute;e d&apos;une seule voix principale m&eacute;lodique accompagn&eacute;e d&apos;accords? Pouvez-vous entendre un accompagnement similaire dans un m&ecirc;me rythme plut&ocirc;t que des lignes m&eacute;lodiques ind&eacute;pendantes avec leurs propres rythmes? Les accords qui soutiennent une ligne m&eacute;lodique principale et ind&eacute;pendante repr&eacute;sentent une texture homophonique.</p>

          <p>Identifiez la texture des autres mouvements. Pouvez-vous entendre l&rsquo;accompagnement des premier et troisi&egrave;me mouvements qui est plut&ocirc;t homophonique et compos&eacute; d&rsquo;accords plut&ocirc;t que polyphonique ayant une ligne m&eacute;lodique ind&eacute;pendante?</p>

          <p><span class="badge">7</span> Quels <b>timbres</b> sonores reconnaissez-vous?</p>

          <p>Le timbre est d&eacute;fini par la qualit&eacute; de son cr&eacute;&eacute;e par diff&eacute;rents instruments. Par exemple, le type de son des instruments &agrave; cordes quand ils jouent ensemble est une qualit&eacute; de son diff&eacute;rente de celle produite par les cuivres comme la trompette ou le cor fran&ccedil;ais. Pouvez-vous d&eacute;crire le timbre du violon? Pouvez-vous entendre les diff&eacute;rentes caract&eacute;ristiques de son selon l&apos;instrument qui joue? Pouvez-vous deviner quels instruments jouent juste &agrave; les entendre?</p>
