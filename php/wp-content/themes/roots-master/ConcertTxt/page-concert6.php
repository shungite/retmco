		<h4><div>Suzie LeBlanc<br>&amp; the poetry of Elizabeth Bishop</div></h4>
		<p>Soprano Suzie LeBlanc will return to our stage for her third MCO appearance, but this time she&rsquo;s planned the concert around a personal project.</p>
		<p>The Acadian singer first connected with the work of American poet Elizabeth Bishop five years ago after finding a leaflet in the basement of a church on the Bay of Fundy. She felt strangely drawn to the little photo of the poet and set out to learn all she could about her.</p>
		<p>The power in Bishop&rsquo;s words had a profound effect on LeBlanc and several composers became aware of her interest &mdash; they, too, were fans!</p>
		<p>Christos Hatzis has set music to the poems <i>I Am in Need of Music</i>, <i>Insomnia</i>, <i>The Unbeliever</i>, and <i>Anaphora</i>; and we will hear <i>Silken Water</i> from <i>The Bishop Suite</i> by Alasdair MacLean.</p>
		<p><b>Elizabeth Bishop</b></p>
		<p>Elizabeth Bishop (1911-1979) was the Poet Laureate of the United States in 1949 and 1950. She won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1956 and the National Book Award in 1970 and, in 1976, was the recipient of the Neustadt International Prize for Literature.</p>
		<p>Bishop was born in Massachusetts, but lived for a time in Great Village, Nova Scotia. It was in the basement of a church on the Bay of Fundy that Acadian Suzie LeBlanc began to explore the poetry of Elizabeth Bishop.</p>

				<p><b>Suzie LeBlanc</b></p>
				<p>Acadian soprano Suzie LeBlanc is one of the most sought after early music vocalists before the public today. She has sung with many of the world&rsquo;s leading early music ensembles in concert and opera performances as well as on film and on disc. Concerts have taken her to festivals all over the world and on the opera stage she has performed for De Nederlandse Opera, Festival de Beaune, Op&eacute;ra de Montr&eacute;al, the Boston Early Music Festival, Tanglewood, Festival Vancouver and Early Music Vancouver.</p>
				<p>She explored and recorded much previously unpublished material while living in Europe, and her musical curiosity has led her toward the repertoire of Acadian folk music, French m&eacute;lodies, lieder and contemporary music as well as to the art of improvisation with jazz violinist Helmut Lipsky and his ensemble Melosph&egrave;re. She now shares her time between Montr&eacute;al and Nova Scotia and continues to tour the world with her many and varied projects.</p>
				<p>Her contributions to early music and to Acadian culture, with the CDs <i>La Mer Jolie</i> and <i>Tout passe</i> and with the documentary <i>Suzie LeBlanc: A Musical Quest</i>, directed by Donald Winkler, have earned her three honorary doctorates. </p>
				<p>Highlights in 2010 included a collaboration with Kent Nagano and the Montr&eacute;al Symphony in a programme of traditional Japanese songs. She also performed in France, England, the US, Brazil and Argentina with Daniel Taylor and the Theatre of Early Music. </p>
				<p>In 2011 she co-chaired the Elizabeth Bishop Centenary Festival in Nova Scotia, and premiered several Canadian pieces commissioned for the centenary celebrations in honour of this great poet. She made her Minnesota Symphony debut as soloist in <i>Messiah</i> and was heard in the same work with the Toronto Symphony. She also performed with Les Voix Humaines and le Studio de Musique Ancienne de Montr&eacute;al.</p>
				<p>Ms LeBlanc&rsquo;s engagements for the 2012/13 season included Mahler&rsquo;s 4th Symphony with Yannick N&eacute;z&eacute;t-S&eacute;guin and Orchestre M&eacute;tropolitain, Graupner cantatas with Les Id&eacute;es Heureuses, Amante Seggreto with Ensemble Constantinople, a recital with Alexander Weimann, a recital tour in Ontario with Robert Kortgaard (&lsquo;The Last Rose of Summer&rsquo;), Bach&rsquo;s Mass in B minor for Kitchener&rsquo;s Grand Philharmonic Choir and <i>Messiah</i> for Symphony Nova Scotia, as well as in Warsaw with <i>Il Fondamento</i>.</p>
				<p>As a legacy project from the Elizabeth Bishop Centenary, Suzie Leblanc has recorded a CD of the poet&rsquo;s work set to music by composers Christos Hatzis, John Plant, Alasdair MacLean and Emily Doolittle. A documentary film, directed by Linda Dornan, on her Newfoundland walk following the 1932 diary of Elizabeth Bishop was released in the fall of 2012.</p>
				<p><b>Wojcieck Kilar</b></p>
				<p>Wojcieck Kilar is one of Poland&rsquo;s most esteemed composers. After attending several musical institutions in Poland, he studied &mdash; on a scholarship from the French government &mdash; with Nadia Boulanger. Subsequently, together with Boleslaw Szabelski, his student Henryk Gorecki, and Krzysztof Penderecki, he belonged to the Polish avant-garde music movement of the &lsquo;60s. In 1977 Kilar was a founding member of the Karol Szymanowski Society. He chaired the Katowice chapter of the Association of Polish Composers for many years and from 1979-81 was vice-chair of this association&rsquo;s national board. He was also a member of the Repertoire Committee for the &lsquo;Warsaw Autumn&rsquo; International Festival of Contemporary Music. In 1991 Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Zanussi made a biographic film about the composer.</p>
				<p>Having received critical success as a classical composer, Kilar in 1959 wrote his first domestic film score and has since written music for some of Poland&rsquo;s most acclaimed directors. He made his English language debut with Francis Ford Coppola&rsquo;s adaptation of <i>Dracula</i>. His other English language features &mdash; Roman Polanski&rsquo;s trio <i>Death and the Maiden</i> (1994), <i>The Ninth Gate</i> (1999) and <i>The Pianist</i> (2002) and Jane Campion&rsquo;s <i>The Portrait of a Lady</i> (1996) &mdash; were typified by his trademark grinding basses and cellos, deeply romantic themes and minimalist chord progressions.</p>
				<p>In addition to his film work, Kilar continues to write and publish purely classical works, which have included the acclaimed <i>Baltic Canticles</i>, the epic <i>Exodus</i> (famous as the trailer music from <i>Schindler&rsquo;s List</i>) and his major work, the <i>September Symphony</i> (2003). Having now abandoned avant-garde music almost entirely, Kilar these days employs a simplified musical language in which sizable masses of sound serve as a backdrop for highlighted melodies. This occurs in compositions that reference folk music (especially Polish Highlander Gorals folk melodies) and in patriotic and religious pieces.</p>
				<p><b>Christos Hatzis</b></p>
				<p>With two Junos, a SOCAN award, and several national and international prizes to his credit, and recent commissions by internationally recognized artists such as violinist Hilary Hahn, percussionist Dame Evelyn Glennie and soprano Suzie LeBlanc &mdash; as well as pop celebrities such as George Dalaras and Sarah Slean &mdash; Christos Hatzis is widely recognized as &lsquo;one of the most important composers writing today&rdquo; (CBC) and &ldquo;a contemporary Canadian master&rdquo; (<i>New Yorker</i>). The numerous performances and CD recordings of his music for Naxos, Deutsche Grammophon, EMI, Analekta, Sony, CBC and other major and independent labels, as well as wide internet distribution of his audio playlist (over 1,700,000 hits since 2008), have garnered a loyal and growing international following for his music. Recent and current works include: the premiere and US and European tour of <i>Coming To</i> and <i>Dystopia</i> by Hilary Hahn with the CD release on DG following in November 2013; Lamento, a song cycle for Sarah Slean and Symphony Nova Scotia released as a music video on CBC; the premiere of <i>Redemption: Book 3</i> by the Winnipeg Symphony in 2013; <i>Departures</i>, Hatzis&rsquo; second flute concerto, which was premiered in August 2011 by Susan Hoeppner and the Kyoto Symphony and by Patrick Gallois and the Thessaloniki State Symphony Orchestra and will be commercially released in 2013 by Naxos (Gallois/TSSO); <i>The Isle is Full of Voices</i>, which will be premiered by the Montr&eacute;al Symphony Orchestra in October 2013 and a full-length ballet for the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, a collaboration with choreographer Mark Godden, for 2014/15. </p>
				<p>Recent and upcoming orchestral performances and tours include: Hatzis&rsquo; <i>Telluric Dances</i> with the Thessaloniki State Orchestra, which culminated in a concert at the Herod Atticus open amphitheatre at the foothill of the Acropolis in 2012; <i>Pyrrichean Dances</i>, with the Wiener Concert Verein orchestra in Vienna in 2012 and a cross-Europe tour of <i>Mirage?</i> (an MCO commission) with Dame Evelyn Glennie and the Berlin Chamber Orchestra in November 2014.</p>
				<p>Hatzis&rsquo; music is influenced by early Christian spirituality, Pythagorean and Hermetic ideas, world cultures and religions, and various classical, jazz and pop music idioms from the past to the present. He is a believer in borderless culture and the uninhibited flow of cultural information, and in the power of contemporary classical music to perform a leading and healing role in social transformation around the world. A professor of composition at the University of Toronto, Hatzis writes extensively on these and related subjects. His writings, audio playlists and other information about the composer are available at <a href="http://www.hatzis.com"><b>hatzis.com</b></a>. </p>
				<p><b>Alasdair MacLean</b></p>
				<p>Alasdair MacLean grew up in Liverpool, Nova Scotia, where, after youthful piano and voice lessons, he spent his teenage years playing in rock and prog-rock bands. Initial composition studies began at Mount Allison University, and continued at the Juilliard School, the Conservatoire Am&eacute;ricain (Fontainebleau), McGill University and the University of Toronto. He has written more than forty commissions, including orchestral, operatic, music theatre, chamber, vocal and solo compositions. MacLean held consecutive positions as composer-in residence with Symphony Nova Scotia and Debut Atlantic, during which he was active in educational outreach, visiting more than thirty schools throughout Atlantic Canada.</p>
