		<h4><div>Anne Manson conducts cellist<br>Ariel Barnes</div></h4>
		<p>This is a late programme change, but change is good! Ariel Barnes, principal cellist of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, has been described as creating a &rdquo;mesmerizing musical experience&ldquo; by combining his &rdquo;deep personal connection&rdquo; (<i>Toronto Live Music Report</i>), with a &ldquo;luscious tone and technical prowess&rdquo; (<i>The Vancouver Sun</i>).</p>
		<p>Barnes was recently selected as one of six cellists across the nation to celebrate the launch of <a href="http://music.cbc.ca/"><b>cbcmusic.ca</b></a> as a featured artist in the Canadian Bach Cello Suite Project and in 2012, was winner of the 2012 Canada Council Instrument Bank Competition. He has been awarded the use of the 1730 Newland Joannes Franciscus Celoniatus cello, built in Turin, Italy.</p>
		<p>Ariel Barnes is passionate about the chamber music literature, and for this concert will perform Haydn's D major cello concerto.</p>
		<p>Also, at this concert Anne Manson presents the first of two works by Leo&#353; Jan&aacute;&#269;ek.</p>
		<p><b>Programming change</b></p>
		<p>The originally-programmed performance and debut of Manitoba composer Heidi Ouellette&rsquo;s <i>Life on Mars</i> has been postponed. In its place, we will present <i>Divertissement</i>, for string quartet and string orchestra, by Canadian composer Pierre Mercure. MCO has performed this work on two occasions, but not since 1988!</p>

		  	<p><b>Ariel Barnes</b></p>
		  	<p>Described as creating a &ldquo;mesmerizing musical experience&rdquo; by combining his &ldquo;deep personal connection&rdquo; (<i>Toronto Live Music Report</i>), &ldquo;luscious tone and technical prowess&rdquo;(<i>Vancouver Sun</i>), cellist Ariel Barnes has been capturing audiences with his imaginative interpretations and commanding stage presence. Equally comfortable in musical languages from the Baroque to music of our modern times, Ariel&rsquo;s performances range from evenings of unaccompanied Bach to world premiers of contemporary art music. Critically acclaimed by the press, he has been hailed as a &ldquo;rising star&rdquo; by the <i>Georgia Straight</i>, &ldquo;a surprising standout&rdquo; by the <i>KW Gazette</i>, &ldquo;new wave&rdquo; by <i>Acadie Nouvelle</i> and &ldquo;a musician of real stature&rdquo; by the <i>Vancouver Sun</i>. His solo and chamber music performances are often broadcast by CBC Radio, and he was recently selected as one of six cellists across the nation to celebrate the launch of cbcmusic.ca as a featured artist in the Canadian Bach Cello Suite Project. With a passion for performing, he has concertized extensively throughout North America and continues to broaden his horizons with engagements in Europe. His solo and chamber music recordings have been received with critical acclaim, having been nominated for a Juno Award and two Western Canadian Music Awards. As a winner of the 2012 Canada Council Instrument Bank Competition, he has been awarded the use of the 1730 Newland Johannes Franciscus Celoniatus cello, built in Turin, Italy, for the next 3 years. In January 2013, Ariel was appointed Principal Cello of the Grammy and Juno award winning Vancouver Symphony Orchestra.</p>
		  	<p>The performance of 21st Century Art Music plays a significant role in Ariel&rsquo;s creative life. Inspired by the collaborative process of creating new music with composers, he has given the world premier of over 50 works. His new project &lsquo;Couloir,&rsquo; with Harpist Heidi Krutzen, keenly focuses on the creation of new music for the rarely heard and evocatively beautiful combination of cello and harp. Described as &ldquo;music&rsquo;s new rare pair&rdquo; (<i>Georgia Straight</i>), they have just released their debut CD <i>Wine Dark Sea</i>, featuring their first three creations with composers Jocelyn Morlock, Baljinder Sekhon, and Glenn Buhr.</p>
		  	<p>As an ardent chamber musician, Ariel performs with Couloir, Turning Point Ensemble and is a regular guest at many international chamber music festivals. He collaborates with fine artists worldwide, and is a former member of Trio Accord and the Borealis String Quartet.</p>
		  	<p>Ariel&rsquo;s solo and chamber music recordings can be heard on Ravello Records (PARMA), Atma Classiques, Skylark Records, Universal Music and Centrediscs.</p>

				<p><b>From Jewish Life: Prayer<br>Ernest Bloch</b></p>
				<p>Although Bloch lived during a time of great experimentation in music, he never abandoned his links with the expressive and emotional schools of the past. Another important influence in his creative personality was the Hebrew musical tradition. He regularly employed the melodic scales and rhythmic patterns of this style, and composed numerous pieces inspired by Jewish subjects. He created the suite of sketches that he called <i>From Jewish Life</i> in 1924. This is heartfelt music, rich in melody, passionate and direct in expression, and therefore admirably suited to the warm voice of the cello. This evening you will hear the suite’s gorgeous opening movement, which Bloch entitled <i>Prayer</i>.</p>
				<p><b>String Quartet No. 1, &lsquo;Kreutzer Sonata&rsquo;<br>Leo&#353; Jan&aacute;&#269;ek</b></p>
				<p><i>Transcribed for string orchestra by Michael Oesterle, on commission from the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra (World premiere performance).</i></p>
				<p>The careers of Jan&aacute;&#269;ek and his contemporaries Gustav Mahler and Jean Sibelius straddle the close of the Romantic era and the beginnings of modernism. All three drew upon both of these schools to create fascinating hybrid styles. Jan&aacute;&#269;ek&rsquo;s music is very much his own: quirky, mercurial, bursting with inventiveness and sharp contrasts of many varieties.</p>
				<p>Pressed to follow family tradition and become a schoolteacher, his love of music could not be denied. His early works display clear influences of Dvo&#345;&aacute;k (whom he came to know personally) and Wagner. Research into the earthy, spontaneous folk music of his native country proved a decisive influence on the already deeply patriotic composer. Despite long years of sustained effort, he gained success only gradually. His final years saw a tremendous resurgence in creativity, brought about in large measure by a passionate (albeit platonic) relationship with Kamila St&ouml;sslov&aacute;, a much younger woman. This period also brought him the greatest acclaim of his career.</p>
				<p>Jan&aacute;&#269;ek&rsquo;s most significant compositions are nine operas, compelling works marked by powerful emotions and melodies patterned on the rhythms of speech. Only <i>Jenufa</i> (Jealousy, 1904), has won lasting international success. Other major scores include numerous choral works and the spectacular <i>Glagolitic Mass</i> (1926) for chorus and orchestra. He composed a handful of symphonic poems in the mold of Liszt and Smetana, but his most significant orchestral works are the vivid rhapsody Taras Bulba and the spectacular Sinfonietta.</p>
				<p>In 1803, Ludwig van Beethoven dedicated his newly-composed Sonata in A Major, Op. 47 for violin and piano to a French violinist named Rodolphe Kreutzer &mdash; who never played it! In 1889, celebrated Russian author Lev Tolstoy published <i>The Kreutzer Sonata</i>, a novella that was inspired by Beethoven&rsquo;s piece. In the story, a man named P&oacute;zdnyshev relates the events leading up to him killing his wife. In a key scene, he attends a performance of the &lsquo;Kreutzer&rsquo; Sonata, performed by his wife and her lover, a violinist named Trukhach&eacute;vski. Ironically, it was he who introduced them. Sometime later he returns unannounced from a business trip, comes upon them together, and stabs her. He is acquitted of murder by a jury that believes he is a wronged husband who killed his wife in order to defend his outraged sense of honour.</p>
				<p>In a possibly unique chain of creation, Tolstoy&rsquo;s musically-inspired novella inspired another piece of music: the first of Jan&aacute;&#269;ek&rsquo;s two string quartets. His first impulse had been to compose a piano trio based on the story, which he did in 1908. It was performed several times over the following 15 years but has since disappeared. In 1923 he used a great deal of material from it in creating String Quartet No. 1, which he drafted in a single week. &ldquo;I had in mind the poor woman portrayed by the Russian writer Tolstoy in <i>The Kreutzer Sonata</i> &mdash; tortured, stricken, worried to death,&rdquo; he wrote to the object of his platonic passion, Kamila St&ouml;sslov&aacute;. The deep compassion with which his operas treated such downtrodden female characters may have been one cause of his interest in composing music inspired by Tolstoy&rsquo;s story.</p>
				<p>The Czech Quartet (which included the celebrated composer Josef Suk as second violinist, and which appears to have commissioned Jan&aacute;&#269;ek&rsquo;s Quartet No. 1) premiered it on 17 October 1924. &ldquo;I have not yet heard anything so magnificent as the way the Czech Quartet played,&rdquo; was how the composer described the performance to Kamila.</p>
				<p>Virtually operatic in its intensity, the piece has four concentrated movements that bear little relationship to traditional ideas of structure. They are as volatile as human beings. The first movement is filled with passionate emotions, restless energy and violent contrasts in dynamics. Only a few fleeting sparks of lyricism light up the scene. The second movement is quirkier yet. Splashed with uneasy tremolos played near the bridge and an atmosphere of tense foreboding heightened by several electrifying increases in speed, it is totally suited to an evocation of a tense and brutal story such as Tolstoy&rsquo;s. Traces of folk dance rhythms such as the polka also play a role.</p>
				<p>The third movement quotes a theme from the first movement of Beethoven&rsquo;s &lsquo;Kreutzer&rsquo; Sonata. Repeated attempts to make warm, lyrical statements are interrupted by furious activity. Although Jan&aacute;&#269;ek left no detailed indications of how the Quartet relates to the story, it’s not hard to imagine this section as representing a heated conversation between characters who are at odds with each other &mdash;one that ends without resolution. Opening as a desolate elegy, the finale takes wing almost into a frenzy, punctuated by frequent pizzicatos and tremolos.</p> 
				<p>MCO Music Director Anne Manson writes, &ldquo;I find Jan&aacute;&#269;ek an incredible visionary. He was trying to do something really unique and way beyond most of his contemporaries in that part of the world. His operas are deeply moving and psychological masterworks, and his two quartets are closest to the operas in terms of programmatic content and abstract expression.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>The MCO will perform the world premiere of Michael Oesterle&rsquo;s transcription of Jan&aacute;&#269;ek&rsquo;s String Quartet No. 2, which the orchestra also commissioned, at the final concert of the season on 3 June.</p>
				<p><b>Cello Concerto No. 2 in D Major, H.VIIB:2<br>Joseph Haydn</b></p>
				<p>Haydn spent the final 48 years of his life in the employ of the Esterh&aacute;zys, a fabulously wealthy noble Hungarian family. Even though he was allowed only rarely to visit the world outside their lavish estates, his music won him a high reputation throughout Europe. &ldquo;I was cut off from the world,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;There was no one to confuse or torment me, and I was forced to become original.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Having a superb orchestra to work with proved crucial in his quest to expand the content and meaning of the symphony as a form of music. In gratitude to his players, he composed many pieces designed specifically to showcase their superb individual skills. They included not only full-scale concertos, but orchestral works featuring numerous solo passages.</p>
				<p>He wrote this concerto in 1783 for Anton Kraft, whom Haydn had personally recruited as principal cellist of the Esterh&aacute;y Orchestra. For a time, many authorities believed that Kraft had composed it himself, the manuscript having disappeared. The reappearance of the original score during the 1930s offered convincing proof of its authenticity.</p>
				<p>This warm-hearted piece presents the soloist with many challenges, yet it is by no means simply a virtuoso vehicle. The richness of the opening movement’s themes is matched by the expansiveness of their treatment. The slow movement offers restful contemplation, disturbed only briefly by an anxious central episode. The finale is a merry rondo, its cheerful main subject resembling a folk song.</p>
