		<h4><div>Scott Yoo conducts Janina Fialkowska</div></h4>
		<p>At the MCO, we cherish our longtime friends, and <b>Janina Fialkowska</b> is our BFF! That goes for <b>Scott Yoo</b>, too! As our guests on numerous occasions, these two wonderful musicians have created many memorable musical moments.</p>
		<p>Janina Fialkowska is known the world over for her exquisite pianism. For almost forty years she has enchanted audiences with her glorious lyrical sound, her sterling musicianship and her profound sense of musical integrity. &ldquo;Indeed, lesser mortals may well weep with envy at such unfaltering authority. She has done her one time mentor, Arthur Rubinstein, proud&rdquo; (<i>Gramophone</i>).</p>
		<p>On this programme is the first of two works by Canadian composer John Burge this season. &ldquo;I was sent some scores of his a while ago,&rdquo; says Anne Manson, &ldquo;and took a look at them, among others, when we were planning the season. I was struck by the strength of his work and its approachability and thought that it would be interesting for the audience to get more than one look at him during the course of the season.&rdquo;</p>
    <p><b>Scott Yoo</b></p>
		<p>A familiar and dynamic figure on the MCO stage, Scott Yoo is currently Music Director and Principal Conductor of Festival Mozaic, and Artistic Director of the Medell&iacute;n Festic&aacute;mara, a chamber music program for underprivileged young musicians.</p>
		<p>Yoo conducted the premiere of <i>Everything That Rises</i> by Randolph Peters, and was pleased to program this reprise performance. </p>

				<p><b>Scott Yoo</b></p>

				<p>After beginning his musical studies at age three, Scott Yoo performed Mendelssohn&rsquo;s Violin Concerto with the Boston Symphony at age twelve. He received first prize in the 1988 Josef Gingold International Violin Competition, the 1989 Young Concert Artists International Auditions, and the 1994 Avery Fisher Career Grant. In 1993, Mr. Yoo founded the Metamorphosen Chamber Orchestra, conducting the ensemble in its series at Jordan Hall in Boston, and in more than ninety performances on tour.</p>

				<p>Scott Yoo has collaborated with such eminent artists as Sarah Chang, Edgar Meyer, Benita Valente, and Dawn Upshaw. He is currently Music Director and Principal Conductor of Festival Mozaic, and Artistic Director of the Medell&iacute;n Festic&aacute;mara, a chamber music program for underprivileged young musicians.</p>

				<p>As a guest conductor, Mr. Yoo has led the Colorado, Dallas, Indianapolis, New World, San Francisco and Utah Symphonies. He regularly conducts the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, and led their Elliott Carter Festival as well as numerous subscription series concerts. In Europe, he has conducted the City of London Sinfonia, the Britten Sinfonia, the Ensemble Orchestral de Paris, Odense Symphony and the Estonian National Symphony. In recent seasons, Mr. Yoo made his debut with the Yomiuri Nippon Orchestra in Tokyo and his Carnegie Hall debut with the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra.</p>

				<p>A proponent of the music of our time, Mr. Yoo has premiered 60 works by 31 composers. With Metamorphosen, he has recorded Mark O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s <i>American Seasons</i> for Sony Classical; John Harbison&rsquo;s chamber orchestra works with soprano Dawn Upshaw for Bridge, nominated for a 1999 National Public Radio Performance Today Award; and song cycles of Earl Kim with sopranos Benita Valente and Karol Bennett for New World&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;named a 2001 Critics Choice by the <i>New York Times</i>. His recent recording projects include complete orchestral works of Earl Kim with the RTE National Orchestra of Ireland for Naxos, and works of Carter, Lieberson, and Ruders with Bridge Records.</p>

				<p>Mr. Yoo has appeared as a conductor/soloist with the San Francisco, Utah, Phoenix, Dallas, and New World Symphonies, and has performed as a chamber musician with Bargemusic, Boston Chamber Music Society, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, and the Seattle Chamber Music Festival.</p>

				<p>Mr. Yoo studied violin with Roman Totenberg, Albert Markov, Paul Kantor and Dorothy DeLay, and conducting with Michael Gilbert and Michael Tilson Thomas.</p>

				<p><b>Janina Fialkowska</b></p>

				<p>Beloved worldwide for her exquisite pianism, Janina Fialkowska has enchanted audiences for over forty years with her glorious lyrical sound, her sterling musicianship and her profound sense of musical integrity. Born in Montr&eacute;al to a Canadian mother and a Polish father, Janina studied in Montr&eacute;al, Paris and at Juilliard. Her career was launched in 1974 by Arthur Rubinstein after her prize-winning performance at his inaugural Master Piano Competition in Israel. She has since performed with all the foremost US, Canadian, European and Asian orchestras&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;many of them numerous times&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;working with conductors such as  Sir Georg Solti, Sir Andrew Davis, Bernard Haitink, Lorin Maazel, Zubin Mehta, Stanislaw Skrowaczewski and Klaus Tennstedt.</p>

				<p>Janina Fialkowska has won special recognition for a series of important premieres, most notably the world premiere performance of a newly discovered piano concerto by Liszt with the Chicago Symphony in 1990 and, in 2010, with the Qu&eacute;bec Symphony Orchestra the world premiere of the Chopin-inspired piano concerto entitled <i>Prelude Variations</i> by John Burge&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;written for and dedicated to Janina. Adding to her already significant discography, in 2010 Ms Fialkowska released three CDs of Chopin&rsquo;s music, all of which received stellar reviews worldwide. &ldquo;Indeed, lesser mortals may well weep with envy at such unfaltering authority.&rdquo; (Bryce Morrison in <i>Gramophone</i> magazine about the pianist&rsquo;s double album <i>Chopin: Etudes, Impromptus, Sonatas</i>.) Her latest ATMA classique CD featuring a selection of &lsquo;25 Lyric Pieces&rsquo; by Grieg was named CD of the week by four German Public Radio channels within two weeks of its release in July 2015, and received stellar reviews in London&rsquo;s <i>Telegraph</i>, <i>Guardian</i> and <i>Sunday Times</i> newspapers (&lsquo;Essential Classical CD of the Week&rsquo;), as well as in the <i>Sueddeutsche Zeitung Munich</i> (&lsquo;A string of jewels&thinsp;...&thinsp;&rsquo;).</p>

				<p>Janina Fialkowska was the Founding Director of the hugely successful Piano Six project and its successor, Piano Plus. This latest project brings together some of Canada&rsquo;s greatest classical pianists, instrumentalists and vocalists with Canadians who, for either geographical or financial reasons, would otherwise be unable to hear this calibre of live classical performance. In 2000, Piano Six won a top Canadian arts award&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the Chalmers.</p>

				<p>In January 2002, at the onset of a major European tour, Ms Fialkowska&rsquo;s career was brought to a dramatic halt by the discovery of a tumour in her left arm. After successful surgery to remove the cancer, Janina underwent further surgery a year later&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;a rare muscle-transfer procedure. After 18 months of performing the Ravel and Prokofiev concertos for left hand (which she transcribed for her right hand) she resumed her two-handed career, beginning with a tremendously successful and highly emotional recital held in Germany in January 2004.</p>

				<p>2011 was Liszt&rsquo;s anniversary year and Janina celebrated it on concert stage and on CD. Her CD release, <i>Liszt Recital</i>, was hailed as &ldquo;the most beautiful Liszt CD of this decade&rdquo; (<i>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</i>).</p>

				<p>In the 2015/16 season, during which she celebrates her 65th birthday, Janina will undertake a Birthday Celebration Tour encompassing several return trips to London and other UK destinations, as well as concerts in Japan, Switzerland, Spain aand Portugal, as well as extended tours in her native Canada and Germany. She will also continue with her fourth International Piano Academy.</p>

				<p>Janina Fialkowska is an Officer of the Order of Canada and holds honorary doctorates from Acadia University and Queen&rsquo;s University. She received the 2012 Governor General&rsquo;s Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Achievement in Classical Music&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;Canada&rsquo;s foremost honour for excellence in the performing arts.</p>

				<p>Ms Fialkowska and her husband, cultural manager Harry Oesterle, live in Bavaria.</p>

				<p><b>Randolph Peters</b></p>

				<p>Winnipeg-born Randolph Peters is a professional freelance composer. He has written operas, symphonies, choral and chamber music, as well as over one hundred film and television scores. His music has been performed around the world.</p>

				<p>Peters has collaborated with authors such as Robertson Davies, Margaret Atwood, and Salman Rushdie, among others. His collaboration with the late Robertson Davies resulted in a new opera for the Canadian Opera Company entitled <i>The Golden Ass</i>. This work played to sold-out houses in April 1999 at the Hummingbird Centre in Toronto.</p>

				<p>As Composer-In-Residence with the Canadian Opera Company (1990-93), Peters was commissioned to write <i>Nosferatu</i>. This opera also appeared in the 1995 season of Manitoba Opera. Peters was also Composer-in-Residence of the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra (1996-2001).</p>

				<p>The MCO previously commissioned his <i>Paradoxes of the Heart</i> (1992) and has performed his <i>Tango for String Orchestra</i> on many occasions.</p>

				<p><b>John Burge</b></p>

				<p>Dr. John Burge was born in Dryden, Ontario in 1961. He holds degrees in Composition and Theory from the Universities of Toronto and British Columbia. Since 1987 he has been teaching at Queen&rsquo;s University in Kingston, Ontario where he is Full Professor in the School of Music. He has written a large body of vocal, chamber, and orchestral compositions but he is particularly well known for his choral music. Many of these choral works have been published by Boosey and Hawkes Music Publishers. His composition <i>Angels&rsquo; Voices</i>, for choir and orchestra, received the 2006 Outstanding New Choral Composition Award from the Association of Canadian Choral Conductors and was performed in Carnegie Hall in 2005.</p>

				<p>John Burge has had a long and productive relationship with the Kingston Symphony and their Music Director, Glen Fast. Since 1991 they have commissioned and premiered many of his orchestral compositions, including a Piano Concerto, Clarinet Concerto, Trumpet Concerto and two symphonies. More recently, Sinfonia Toronto has been programming and commissioning Burge compositions, and in 2008 this ensemble released a CD devoted entirely to some of Burge&rsquo;s string orchestra music on the Marquis Classics label. The title track of this disc, <i>Flanders Fields Reflections</i>, received the 2009 Juno Award for Best Canadian Classical Composition. With other large ensemble works having titles such as <i>Snowdrift</i>, <i>Rocky Mountain Overture</i>, <i>Upper Canada Fiddle Suite</i>, and <i>The Canadian Shield</i>, it is obvious that a number of his works draw their influence from a Canadian perspective. Orchestras and audiences seem taken with these works, and they have received numerous performances across Canada and as far away as Brazil and Russia.</p>

				<p><b>Everything That Rises<br>Randolph Peters</b></p>

				<p><i>This piece was premiered by the MCO last season. The composer has provided the following note:</i></p>

				<p>The idea behind this piece refers to French philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin&rsquo;s conception of &lsquo;Omega Point&rsquo; (from Faith in Man (1947) and The Future of Man (1959):</p>

				<p>&ldquo;Remain true to yourself, but move ever upward toward greater consciousness and greater love! At the summit you will find yourselves united with all those who, from every direction, have made the same ascent. For everything that rises must converge.&rdquo;</p>

				<p><b>Piano Concerto No. 4, in G Major, Op. 58<br>Ludwig van Beethoven</b></p>

				<p>As with the symphony, Beethoven&rsquo;s makeover process on the concerto was a gradual one. First, there were lessons to learn and dues to pay. He arrived in Vienna at the end of 1792, intending merely to finish his musical education with Haydn before returning to Bonn. Circumstances, his magnificent talents in particular, led him to change those plans. The Austrian capital was destined to be the centre of his activities for the rest of his life.</p>

				<p>He won his first fame in Vienna as a pianist, performing in the city&rsquo;s fashionable salons and concert rooms. He gradually made a name for himself through his bold performing style, which, as with Mozart, included a brilliant talent for improvisation. During this period, he composed solo piano works for his own performance. He revised certain of his existing creations as well, including the Piano Concerto in B-flat Major. His first fully completed work of this kind, he may have begun it as early as 1788, in Bonn. It was the earliest orchestral work that he was prepared to acknowledge (a Concerto in E-flat Major &lsquo;for harpsichord or piano,&rsquo; dates from approximately a decade earlier. It exists only in a version where the orchestral part has been arranged for piano). The much-revised B-flat Concerto was published in 1801 as &lsquo;No. 2.&rsquo; Concerto &lsquo;No. 1&rsquo; had been published in 1797, and No. 3 in C Minor followed in 1803.</p>

				<p>He composed the exceptionally beautiful Concerto No. 4 in 1805 and 1806. During this astonishingly fertile period, he also produced the Fourth Symphony and the Violin Concerto, pieces which share the piano concerto&rsquo;s contented nature. As he had done with his three previous piano concertos, he played the first performance himself, in March 1807, before an aristocratic audience in the Vienna home of his friend, Prince Lobkowitz. Listeners responded with only polite applause, and the public debut proved even less successful. It was only when no less a piano soloist than Felix Mendelssohn took it up during the 1830s that it finally began to make its mark.</p>

				<p>Its very beginning is one of its most arresting features. The piano, rather than the orchestra, has the first word, and it enters not with crashing chords (that salvo would have to wait for the &lsquo;Emperor&rsquo; Concerto, No. 5), but with simple, gentle phrases. The effect is magical, establishing the opening movement&rsquo;s tranquil mood with one brief, telling stroke.</p>

				<p>The brief second movement is another gem. It has been said to evoke the mythological Orpheus taming wild beasts with his lyre. The orchestra&rsquo;s lower strings begin the conversation gruffly. The piano responds with soothing caresses. The orchestra&rsquo;s protestations gradually lose steam until the soloist delivers such an impassioned plea for conciliation that the orchestra can only meekly capitulate. The concluding, high-spirited rondo follows on without a break. It is the most conventional part of the concerto, but Beethoven peppered it with enough individual touches of humour and instrumental colour (introducing trumpets and timpani into the concerto for the first time) to ensure it is worthy of the preceding movements.</p>

				<p><b>Flanders Fields Reflections<br>John Burge</b></p>

				<p>This piece for string orchestra was commissioned by Sinfonia Toronto and was premiered by that ensemble in 2006. When it was released on CD three years later (Marquis), it won the Juno Award for Best Classical Composition.</p>

				<p>It was inspired by the famous poem that Canadian physician John McCrae wrote in 1915, while he was serving war duty in Belgium. Each of the five movements reflects upon a specific phrase from the poem.</p>

				<ol>
				<li><i>The Poppies Blow</i>: The music captures the melancholy tone of the poem, while imitating the sighing of the wind across the field and through the flowers.</li>
				<li><i>Still Bravely Singing</i>: A solo violin speaks for the gentle larks, all the other strings for the conflict raging below.</li>
				<li><i>We Are the Dead</i>: Burge pays tribute to the slain soldiers with a funeral march whose restraint makes it all the more poignant.</li>
				<li><i>Loved and Were Loved</i>: To counter the preceding movement, Burge offers an outpouring of warm emotion to portray the love that filled the lives of those who died in combat&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;love both offered and received.</li>
				<li><i>We Shall Not Sleep</i>: This gently flowing finale skillfully mingles reflection with glimmers of hope for a better, wiser future.</li>
