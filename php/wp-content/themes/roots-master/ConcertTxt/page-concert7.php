		<h4><div>&ldquo;Completely engaging from the moment<br>they walked on stage&rdquo;</div></h4>
		<p>You never know where an MCO concert will take you, but you&rsquo;re always happy when you get there! Trumpet virtuoso Guy Few and bassoonist Nadina Mackie Jackson have planned a little jaunt for us with something they call <i>Carnets de voyages</i> &mdash; kind of a musical mystery tour. Roll up!</p>
		<p>&ldquo;... it was Guy Few and Nadina Mackie Jackson who stole the show Tuesday. This duo is not what you expect of a virtuoso classical outfit ... an example of cutting edge performance style&rdquo; (Guelph Mercury).</p>
		<p>Few and Mackie Jackson are artistic co-directors of the Grand River Baroque Festival. Guy is also a sessional lecturer at Wilfrid Laurier University where he teaches trumpet and chamber music. He is a Yamaha artist.</p>
		<p><b>GUY&amp;NADINA</b></p>
		<p>&ldquo;Few and Jackson play with polished tone, immaculate intonation and infectious high spirits; it&rsquo;s obvious they&rsquo;re having a blast&rdquo; (All Music) is how critics have described Guy and Nadina. Known internationally as soloists, chamber musicians, recitalists and fashionistas, Guy Few and Nadina Mackie Jackson have performed in Canada and the USA as concert soloists, multi-instrumental recitalists and recording artists.</p>

				<p><b>guy&amp;nadina</b></p>
				<p>&ldquo;Few and Jackson play with polished tone, immaculate intonation and infectious high spirits; it&rsquo;s obvious they&rsquo;re having a blast&rdquo; (All Music) is how critics have described guy&amp;nadina. Known internationally as soloists, chamber musicians, recitalists and fashionistas, Guy Few and Nadina Mackie Jackson have performed in Canada and the USA as concert soloists, multi-instrumental recitalists and recording artists. In the 2011/12 season guy&amp;nadina toured in British Columbia, the Yukon, and the Prairies, and were featured at the Oregon Bach Festival. 2012/13 found them in Ontario and Atlantic Canada presenting <i>Carnets de Voyages</i> (The Travel Book). Acclaimed recording artists, guy&amp;nadina have released three blockbuster CDs, each one expanding the concerto repertoire for trumpet and bassoon. <i>Bacchanale</i> (TCO/Mallon), won &lsquo;Best Classical Orchestral Album 2009&rsquo; from Just Plain Folks Music Awards. <i>Romanza</i> (TCO/McGegan), was a media favourite, garnering rave reviews from IDRS and ITG among many others. <i>After Hours</i> gave everyone a taste of the duo and their favourite party pieces. Spring 2013 was celebrated with the release of <i>Stories from the World &mdash; Canadian Concerto Project</i>, exploring contemporary jazz and the inspiration of exotic locations &mdash; Mathieu Lussier, Michael Occhipinti and Glenn Buhr with guy&amp;nadina, the Group of Twenty-Seven and Eric Paetkau, taking classical music to a new place!</p>
				<p>Commissioning and recording have built and sustained guy&amp;nadina. Through the support of CBC, FACTOR and the Ontario Arts Council, they now have four new solo concerti, three double concerti, one triple concerto and a symphony, along with many smaller gems. As dedicated teachers and music advocates, guy&amp;nadina are in great demand as speakers, master teachers and interpretational coaches. Their hosts have included the University of British Columbia, Ithaca College, Scotiafest, the University of Manitoba, and Mount Royal University. Guy maintains a studio at Wilfrid Laurier University, teaching trumpet and coaching chamber music. Nadina teaches at the University of Toronto and the Royal Conservatory&rsquo;s Glenn Gould School.</p>
				<p><b>Guy Few</b></p>
				<p>As a pianist, trumpeter, cornist, and singer, Guy Few delights audiences with his intensity and charm. Montr&eacute;al&rsquo;s <i>Le Devoir</i> calls him &ldquo;outrageously gifted&rdquo; and &ldquo;quite simply phenomenal.&rdquo; Equally at home in classical or contemporary genres, he is in great demand as a soloist, regularly performing with many orchestras and festivals in Canada and the USA. Through the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the Canada Council and the Ontario Arts Council, he has debuted numerous new works by Canadian composers, including Glenn Buhr, Alain Trudel, Melissa Hui, Mathieu Lussier, Boyd McDonald and Jacques H&eacute;tu. He has recorded for SNE, Arsis Classics, CBC Musica Viva, CBC SM5000, Naxos, MSR and the H&auml;nssler Classics labels.

				<p>Guy has been invited as a professor, adjudicator, soloist, principal and recitalist to festivals all over North America, while clinics and master classes have been presented worldwide for festivals including Scotiafest, Takefu International Music Festival, Orford Arts Centre and the Banff Centre for the Arts &mdash; as well as post-secondary institutions such as the Montr&eacute;al Conservatory, University of Toronto, Memorial University of Newfoundland, State University of New York at Fredonia and Sonoma State University.</p>
				<p>Guy is a gold medal graduate of Wilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo, Ontario, and holds a Fellowship Diploma from Trinity College, London, England.

Guy has appeared on CBC-TV, CTV, BRAVO, TV5 and European television broadcasts and is heard regularly on CBC Radio, Classical 96.3 and NPR.</p>
				<p>A Yamaha artist, Guy is a part time faculty member at Wilfrid Laurier University where he teaches trumpet and chamber music.</p>
				<p><b>Nadina Mackie Jackson</b></p>
				<p>Nadina Mackie Jackson records and performs worldwide on both modern and historical bassoons, has recorded 11 solo and chamber music CDs and can be heard on over 100 orchestral recordings on the London Decca, Sony, ATMA and Naxos labels.</p>
				<p>Her current recording season included the much-anticipated <i>Vivaldi Concerti, Volume I</i>, with Nicholas McGegan, followed by 24 Solos by Jean-Daniel Braun. She won &lsquo;Best Classical Orchestral Album of the Year&rsquo; with Guy Few and the Toronto Chamber Orchestra in the 2009 Just Plain Folks Music Awards for her FACTOR-backed concerto album, <i>Bacchanale</i>, and has received widespread praise for <i>Romanza</i>, the album of 19th century concerti.</p>
				<p>Nadina has appeared as soloist with l&rsquo;Orchestre Symphonique de Montr&eacute;al, Toronto Chamber Orchestra, Group of 27, Les Id&eacute;es Heureuses (Montr&eacute;al), Cayuga Chamber Orchestra (Ithaca, New York), the Grand River Baroque Festival Soloists, Prince George Symphony Orchestra and l&rsquo;Orchestre Symphonique de Trois-Rivi&egrave;res. She regularly tours and performs across Canada and the United States in recital and as a concerto soloist with trumpeter/pianist Guy Few.</p>
