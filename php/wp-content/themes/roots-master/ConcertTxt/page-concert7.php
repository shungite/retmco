		<h4><div>Music musicians<br>love best</div></h4>
		<p>Our musicians love to talk about music! They talk about works they like to hear, which pieces influenced them most, and so on, but what they get passionate about is the music they like to perform themselves. This is the music that makes an MCO Chamber Night special.</p>
		<p>Winds are featured prominently, with a Beethoven octet and several overtures from Mozart operas arranged for those instruments.</p>
		<p>Another program highlight will be Dvo&#345;&aacute;k&rsquo;s A major sextet, with its Slavonic folklore influences. Composed in just two weeks in May of 1878, it was the first work of Dvo&#345;&aacute;k&rsquo;s to be premiered outside of Bohemia.</p>
		<p>For many loyal MCO fans, the newest CD in their collection is likely to be MCO Concertmaster Karl Stobbe&rsquo;s Ysaÿe Sonatas for Solo Violin. How exciting to be able to hear some of it live!
</p>
		<p><b>Stobbe + Ysa&#255;e</b></p>
		<p>MCO Concertmaster Karl Stobbe has just released his Avie Records recording of the six sonatas for solo violin by the late romantic composer and violinist Eug&egrave;ne Ysa&#255;e. Considered some of the most challenging works for solo violin, these extraordinary pieces use every colour and nuance of the violin, from the Spanish flair of the 6th sonata to the exquisite lyricism of the 2nd.</p>
		<p>Anne Manson: &ldquo;The beautiful, lyrical quality of Karl&rsquo;s playing on this exquisite gem of a recording demonstrates once again how lucky we are to have him as Concertmaster of the MCO.&rdquo;</p>

				<p><b>Opera Overtures, arranged for wind octet<br>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</b></p>
				<p>A small resident ensemble of wind instruments (a harmonie) had been a common fixture in the homes of wealthy mid-European aristocrats since the early eighteenth century. The musicians (who weren&rsquo;t always professionals) provided pleasant, undemanding music &mdash; marches, dances, serenades and such — to be heard discretely in the background during the lavish dinners given by their employers. They did so far less expensively than an orchestra! One of the most prominent composers of such music was the immensely prolific and talented German, Georg Philipp Telemann (1681-1767). He named his numerous contributions to the repertoire Tafelmusik (table music). He scored some of them for ensembles that included strings as well as winds.</p>
				<p>A major upgrade in playing standards for the harmonie occurred in 1782, when Emperor Joseph II of Austria (he who is portrayed as such a dolt in Amadeus), founded his own group. Not for him the amateurs who filled the ranks of many other harmonies &mdash; his wind band consisted solely of virtuoso artists drawn from the orchestra of Vienna&rsquo;s Imperial Court Theatre. Among them was the eminent clarinetist Anton Stadler, for whom Mozart composed his Quintet and Concerto.</p>
				<p>Also in the band were Johann Nepomuk Went and Joseph Triebensee, who also prepared the hundreds of transcriptions that the imperial harmonie performed, since there was very little existing music for this type of group. They drew upon a vast array of sources for these arrangements, from operas and ballets to piano sonatas, symphonies and oratorios. Many of the most popular melodies of the day flowed through their pens.</p>
				<p>Mozart arrived in Vienna in 1781, having deserted his native Salzburg, which he considered musically backward. He was very interested in creating music for as popular a medium as the harmonie, to the point of expressing a willingness to work in the field as an arranger rather than a composer if need be. On 20 July 1782, shortly after the successful premiere of his comic opera The Abduction from the Seraglio, he wrote to his father Leopold in Salzburg as follows: &ldquo;Well, I am up to my eyes in work. By Sunday week I have to arrange my opera for wind instruments, otherwise someone else will beat me to it and get the profits instead of me…You have no idea how difficult it is to arrange a work of this kind for wind instruments, so that it suits them and at the same time loses none of its effect.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>When arranging this music, it must have been easier to transcribe purely instrumental works such as these than arias, ensembles and choruses, where the vocal line would need to be included as well.</p>
				<p>Mozart composed <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i> in 1786, Don Giovanni in 1787, and The Magic Flute in 1791.</p>
				<p><b>Sonata in E Major, Op. 27 No. 6<br>Eugène Ysa&yuml;e</b></p>
				<p>Belgian musician Ysa&yuml;e’s great and multiple talents led to a brilliant career as violinist, composer and conductor. Several generations of violinists preceded him within the family. Admitted to the Li&egrave;ge Conservatory at age nine, he later studied with the distinguished violinists Henryk Wieniawski and Henri Vieuxtemps. He landed his first professional position as concertmaster of the orchestra that later became the Berlin Philharmonic. Performances of the concertos that his teachers had composed helped him establish an international reputation, not only with audiences but with his fellow violinists as well. &ldquo;Ysa&yuml;e was on a solitary peak, streets above all contemporary fiddlers, in a class of his own,&rdquo; said his distinguished contemporary violinist, Carl Flesch. &ldquo;In our memories he will forever remain the knight of the violin, the last grand virtuoso, an unforgettable landmark in the history of our art.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Ysa&yuml;e’s friendships with many of the era&rsquo;s finest composers led to their dedicating to him such superlative works as César Franck&rsquo;s Sonata for violin and piano, Gabriel Faur&eacute;&rsquo;s Piano Quintet No. 1, Ernest Chausson&rsquo;s Po&egrave;me for violin and orchestra, and the string quartets of Camille Saint-Sa&euml;ns and Claude Debussy. Debussy praised his &ldquo;freedom of expression&rdquo; and &ldquo;pure beauty of tone.&rdquo; Ysa&yuml;e also found considerable success on the podium, serving for example as music director of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra from 1918 to 1922. </p>
				<p>He began composing as a child and continued to write music until almost the end of his life &mdash; in fact a large percentage of his musical catalogue dates from the period after he withdrew from performing for health reasons. His compositions range from innovative works for solo violin to chamber pieces, eight violin concertos, and a full-length opera, <i>Pi&eacute;re li houye&ucirc;</i>, which is sung in the Walloon language of his native country.</p>
				<p>Inspired by hearing the esteemed Hungarian violinist Joseph Szigeti perform the magnificent six Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin by Johann Sebastian Bach, Ysaÿe set out to compose something similar in layout but more contemporary in style and content. Recalling the creative inspiration and process that Sir Edward Elgar had followed in composing the &lsquo;Enigma&rsquo; Variations for orchestra (1899), in Ysa&yuml;e’s <i>Six Sonatas for Solo Violin</i>, Op. 27 (1924) he portrayed six of his younger fellow violinists with whom he was friends. They were Joseph Szigeti, Jacques Thibaud, George Enescu, Fritz Kreisler, Mathieu Crickboom and Manuel Quiroga. Once the idea had seized him, he shut himself away in his seaside villa at Le Zoute. He emerged after 24 hours of uninterrupted labour with detailed sketches for all six sonatas.</p>
				<p>Throughout them, he employed numerous contemporary techniques because he believed that &ldquo;at the present day the tools of violin mastery, of expression, technique, mechanism, are far more necessary than in days gone by. In fact they are indispensable, if the spirit is to express itself without restraint.&rdquo; This set of sonatas places high technical demands on its performers. Yet Ysa&yuml;e repeatedly warned performers that they should never forget actually to play, instead of becoming preoccupied with technical elements. A violin master, he wrote, &ldquo;must be a violinist, a thinker, a poet, a human being, he must have known hope, love, passion and despair, he must have run the gamut of the emotions in order to express them all in his playing.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>The movements of some of the sonatas simply bear tempo markings, while Ysa&yuml;e gave others such poetic titles as <i>Obsession</i>, <i>Danse rustique</i> and <i>Les Furies</i>. Two of them have four movements, one has three, one has two, and two of them, Nos. 3 and 6, are cast in single, seamless units. </p>
				<p>Manuel Quiroga, the dedicatee of Sonata No. 6, was the only one of the sonatas&rsquo; six dedicatees who never played &lsquo;his&rsquo; piece in public, due to injury. Ysa&yuml;e composed this spectacular piece in the style of the Latin/African folk dance called the <i>habanera</i>. The characteristic rhythm is familiar from the aria with which the title character in Bizet&rsquo;s opera <i>Carmen</i> introduces herself.</p>
				<p>Karl Stobbe&rsquo;s excellent CD of the six Ysaÿe sonatas is for sale in the lobby at tonight’s concert. </p>
				<p><b>Octet in E-flat Major, Op. 103<br>Ludwig van Beethoven</b></p>
				<p>Beethoven composed this mellifluous and entertaining work in 1792 or 1793, either just before he departed from his native city, Bonn, or just after he arrived in Vienna to study with Joseph Haydn. It had not been published by the time of his death. At some point during the nineteenth century a publisher or editor assigned it a misleadingly high opus number. That person may have been looking to earn some extra money by passing it off as a mature work by the then-celebrated Beethoven, or was simply continuing a process of assigning a catalogue number to every one of Beethoven’s compositions. A chronologically accurate designation of Opus 103 would place the Octet 20 years ahead of its actual date, during the period between the eighth and ninth symphonies.</p>
				<p>Beethoven composed it for the wind ensemble that his employer, the Austrian nobleman, Archduke Maximilian Franz, maintained in his residence in Bonn. Mozart, with his emotionally bleak Serenade in C Minor, K. 388, and grandly-scaled, superbly varied &lsquo;Gran Partita&rsquo; in B-flat Major, K. 361, had proven that it was possible to compose substantial works in this genre. But in Beethoven&rsquo;s Octet (which he scored for pairs of oboes, clarinets, bassoons and horns) he set his sights at ground level rather than the skies, and produced a skilful and diverting, but not at all profound, composition. He did think enough of it to rework it in 1797 into a String Quintet, Op. 4. It also appeared as a Piano Trio, Op. 63, although in that instance he may not have reworked it himself.</p>
				<p>Beethoven appears to have intended the Octet to be a five-movement work. Eventually he discarded what he had planned to be the fourth movement, an andante in the form of a rondo. It was published separately as WoO 25 (<i>Werk ohne Opuszahl</i>), meaning &lsquo;work without opus number.&rsquo;</p>
				<p>The Octet&rsquo;s opening movement is brisk and refreshing. In the songful, smoothly flowing second movement, <i>Andante</i>, Beethoven gives the first oboe a quasi-soloistic role. The second pair of movements is more compact. The <i>minuet</i> is a thoroughly jovial affair, much closer to a scherzo than a formal ballroom dance. The <i>Presto</i> finale maintains the party mode.</p>
				<p>In November 1793, Beethoven sent some of his recent works to Archduke Maximilian as evidence of the progress he was making as a composer. The Octet was one of them. Haydn wrote to the nobleman at the same time, saying, &ldquo;On the basis of these pieces, expert and amateur alike cannot but admit that Beethoven will in time become one of the great musical artists in Europe, and I shall be proud to call myself his teacher.&rdquo;</p>
				<p><b>Sextet in A Major, Op. 48<br>Antonín Dvo&#345;&aacute;k</b></p>
				<p>For Dvo&#345;&aacute;k, music&rsquo;s primary function was to praise the many aspects of life that gave him joy. As he put it in a letter to a friend, &ldquo;Today I have just finished the second movement of my new symphony, and am again as happy and contented in my work as I always have been and, God grant, may always be, for my slogan is and always shall be: God, love and country! And that alone can lead to a happy goal.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>He possessed an unsurpassed ability to subject the appealing themes that he composed, many of them patterned on the folk music of his native Bohemia (now the Czech Republic), to the disciplines of classical composition. This talent earned him a lofty position in musical history. His finest creations offer a virtually irresistible blend of art and craft, of emotion and intellect. </p>
				<p>In the mid-1870s, Johannes Brahms sat on the judging panel for a stipend that the Austrian government offered to financially challenged young musicians. That’s how he first encountered Dvo&#345;&aacute;k&rsquo;s music. He immediately fell in love with it, and for the rest of his life he exerted his considerable influence to encourage and promote his young colleague. He introduced Dvo&#345;&aacute;k to his Berlin publisher, Fritz Simrock, for example, and to his good friend, the eminent violinist Joseph Joachim. Both of them took up Dvo&#345;&aacute;k&rsquo;s cause with a zeal virtually equal to that of Brahms &mdash; Simrock largely for financial gain, Joachim for altruistic artistic reasons.</p>
				<p>Dvo&#345;&aacute;k composed a substantial quantity of chamber music, with a pronounced emphasis on ensembles including strings. His catalogue includes 14 string quartets, three string quintets and two each of quartets for piano and strings and quintets for piano and strings. He created his sole venture into the string sextet (a work scored for pairs of violins, violas and cellos) in the final two weeks of May 1878. This was a banner year for him. He composed the Sextet immediately after the first set of Slavonic Dances, the works whose exuberant exoticism earned his breakthrough to an international audience. He created the charming Bagatelles for strings and harmonium during this same intensely creative period. In all three scores he followed his standard practice of not quoting actual folk melodies, but composing original themes in folk style. </p>
				<p>The Joachim Quartet and two assisting artists performed the Sextet’s premiere (as well as that of the String Quartet in E-flat Major, Op. 51) in front of a distinguished audience at a soirée in Dvo&#345;&aacute;k&rsquo;s honour that Joachim hosted in his Berlin home on 29 July 1879. &ldquo;From all accounts, Dvo&#345;&aacute;k was shy and overawed at being surrounded by so many notables of the German world,&rdquo; wrote author Hans-Hubert Sch&ouml;nzeler, &ldquo;but both the Sextet and the Quartet were an eminent success. It must have been the first time since the days of the many Bohemian &eacute;migr&eacute;s (who traveled throughout Europe in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries) that Czech chamber music works had their first performance outside the borders of their composers&rsquo; native country. </p>
				<p>&ldquo;Both Joachim and (another eminent violinist) Joseph Hellmesberger took to the Sextet and played it wherever and whenever they could. This is not surprising, for its combination of classical form and Bohemian exuberance makes this work come as near to perfection as one can hope for on this earth.&rdquo; The composer long remembered the rapturous reception it received at Joachim&rsquo;s soir&eacute;e. Brahms said of the Sextet, &ldquo;it is infinitely beautiful. This glorious ingenuity, freshness and beauty of sound ...&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Only a small number of string sextets preceded Dvo&#345;&aacute;k&rsquo;s, including pieces by Luigi Boccherini, Louis Spohr and the two by Brahms. Tchaikovsky’s Sextet (subtitled Souvenir of Florence), followed in 1890, and the original version of Schoenberg&rsquo;s <i>Transfigured Night</i>, in 1899. This is an exceptionally challenging medium, falling somewhere between quartet and string orchestra. The difficulty of bringing together six equally matched players has resulted in all of the string sextets being performed on occasion by larger groups of players. </p>
				<p>The warmth of Dvo&#345;&aacute;k&rsquo;s glorious piece, which author Alec Robertson labeled &ldquo;a brightly coloured travel poster advertising Czechoslovakia,&rdquo; shines through from the very first bar. Dvo&#345;&aacute;k added irresistible exuberance and tunefulness almost immediately. He pared the music down to a whisper before capping the movement with a sonorous close.</p>
				<p>The Sextet&rsquo;s folk roots are displayed most directly in the second and third movements. The second is a <i>dumka</i>, a type of lament that is interrupted by outbursts of joyful music. It originated in Ukraine but was taken up by composers from several east-European lands, including the Russians Tchaikovsky and Mussorgsky. Dvo&#345;&aacute;k&rsquo;s Piano Trio in E Minor, Op. 90 consists of six <i>dumky</i>. The sub-sections of the Sextet&rsquo;s <i>Dumka</i> include a slow, quasi-Hungarian episode and a tender lullaby. </p>
				<p>Although Dvo&#345;&aacute;k labeled the third movement &lsquo;Furiant,&rsquo; after a lively Bohemian folk dance that he had included in the Slavonic Dances, this spirited piece lacks the form’s typical cross-rhythms. The finale is a set of variations on a melancholy theme. They range from tender and pensive to vivacious, and Dvo&#345;&aacute;k crowned them with a dazzling concluding section.</p>
