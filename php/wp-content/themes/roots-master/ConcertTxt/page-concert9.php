				<p><b>Isabel Bayrakdarian</b></p>

				<p>In 1997 Isabel Bayrakadarian received an honours degree in biomedical engineering from the University of Toronto. That same year she was a winner of the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions. Luckily for music lovers she chose the latter milestone upon which to base a career. Since then she has become an eagerly anticipated visitor to opera houses and concert halls the world over and is admired equally for her stunning stage presence and exceptional musicality.</p>

				<p>In 1999 she scored a notable success in the Lyric Opera of Chicago&rsquo;s world premiere production of William Bolcom&rsquo;s <i>A View from the Bridge</i> and in the following year won first prize in Pl&aacute;cido Domingo&rsquo;s Operalia competition. She launched 2002 with her San Francisco Opera debut, as Valencienne in <i>The Merry Widow</i>, and closed it with her Metropolitan Opera debut, in the New York premiere of Bolcom&rsquo;s opera. Later, Mozart became a specialty: Zerlina in <i>Don Giovanni</i> (New York, Houston, Salzburg), Susanna in <i>Le nozze di Figaro</i> (Los Angeles, London), and Pamina in <i>The Magic Flute</i> (New York, Toronto). Her roles at her home-base theatre, Toronto&rsquo;s Canadian Opera Company, have ranged from Gluck&rsquo;s <i>Euridice</i> to Debussy&rsquo;s <i>M&eacute;lisande</i> to Poulenc&rsquo;s Blanche in <i>Dialogues des Carm&eacute;lites</i>&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and away from home she&rsquo;s shone as Monteverdi&rsquo;s <i>Poppea</i> in Barcelona, Handel&rsquo;s <i>Romilda</i> (Serse) in Dresden, and Jan&aacute;ček&rsquo;s <i>Vixen</i> in New York, Florence, and the Saito Kinen Festival in Matsumoto, Japan.</p>

				<p>Also an active concertizer, Isabel has appeared with the premier orchestras of numerous North American and European cities with such eminent conductors as Seiji Ozawa, Michael Tilson Thomas, Christoph Eschenbach, Nikolaus Harnoncourt, James Levine, Anne Manson, Bramwell Tovey and Richard Bradshaw. Her versatility is further reflected in being the featured vocalist on, amongst others, the soundtracks of the blockbuster film <i>The Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers</i> and Atom Egoyan&rsquo;s Ararat. Additional interesting musical explorations have included singing the national anthem at the Closing Ceremony of the Pan Am Games in Toronto in front of over 50,000 people and broadcast live to millions around the world.</p>

				<p>Bayrakdarian is the winner of four consecutive Juno Awards for Best Classical Album (Vocal). However, her happiest collaborations, personal and professional, have involved the Armenian-Canadian pianist and composer Serouj Kradjian, her frequent accompanist and arranger and (not least) her husband and the father of their two young children. Their Nonesuch CD <i>Gomidas Songs</i> promoted and popularized the work of Armenian composer Gomidas Vartabed, earning them a Grammy nomination in 2009. Their collaboration on <i>Troubadour &amp; the Nightingale</i> (2013) with the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra and Anne Manson received yet another Juno nomination.</p>

				<p>Other recordings with orchestra include Henryk G&oacute;recki&rsquo;s Symphony No. 3 with John Axelrod conducting the Danish National Symphony Orchestra, released on the Sony Classical label. Her latest recording <i>Il Tramonto</i>, with the Orchestre Symphonique de Laval and Alain Trudel was released in September 2015, on the ATMA Classique label.</p>

				<p>Ms Bayrakdarian has received many awards, including the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee and the Diamond Jubilee Medals. In 2015, she was awarded Doctor of Letters, <i>honoris causa</i>, by Canada&rsquo;s Wilfrid Laurier University.</p>

				<p><b>Roberto Sierra</b></p>

				<p>For more than three decades the works of American composer Roberto Sierra have been part of the repertoire of many leading orchestras, ensembles and festivals in the USA and Europe. At the inaugural concert of the 2002 world-renowned Proms in London, his Fandangos was performed by the BBC Symphony Orchestra in a concert that was broadcast by both the BBC Radio and Television throughout the UK and Europe. Many major American and European orchestras and international ensembles have commissioned and performed his works. Among those institutions are the orchestras of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, New Mexico, Houston, Minnesota, Dallas, Detroit, San Antonio and Phoenix, as well as the American Composers Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic, Los Angeles Philharmonic, National Symphony Orchestra, Royal Scottish National Orchestra, the Tonhalle Orchestra of Zurich, and the Spanish orchestras of Madrid, Galicia, Castilla y Le&oacute;n and  Barcelona.</p>

				<p>In 2003 Sierra was awarded the Academy Award in Music by the American Academy of Arts and Letters. The award states: &ldquo;Roberto Sierra writes brilliant music, mixing fresh and personal melodic lines with sparkling harmonies and striking rhythms&thinsp;&hellip;&thinsp;&rdquo; He has served as Composer-in-Residence with the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, The Philadelphia Orchestra, The Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra and New Mexico Symphony. In 2010 he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>

				<p>The composer&rsquo;s music may be heard on CDs issued by Naxos, EMI, UMG&rsquo;s EMARCY, New World Records, Albany Records, Koch, New Albion, Koss Classics, BMG, Fleur de Son and other labels.  Sierra has been nominated twice for a Grammy under best contemporary composition category, first in 2009 for <i>Missa Latina</i> (Naxos), and in 2014 for his Sinfonia No. 4 (Naxos).</p>

				<p>Roberto Sierra was born in 1953 in Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, and studied composition both in Puerto Rico and Europe, where one of his teachers was Gy&ouml;rgy Ligeti at the Hochschule f&uuml;r Musik in Hamburg, Germany.</p>

				<p><b>Boyd MacKenzie</b></p>

				<p>Boyd MacKenzie is a violinist with the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra, and was also a long-time member of the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra and MusikBarock Ensemble. He serves as the contractor and concert manager of the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra and manages the MCO&rsquo;s Minstrel booking agency. Boyd has composed a number of scores for film and television, and has arranged music for a variety of ensembles. He is a founding member of the Cambrian Quartet, which has performed throughout Manitoba, as well as in the U.S. and England. A graduate of Brandon University&rsquo;s School of Music, he studied with Francis Chaplin, Joel Hekester (former concertmaster of the Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam) and Paul Makanowitsky (Meadowmount School of Music, New York). Boyd performed with the Utrecht Symphony Orchestra, Netherlands, before returning to Canada and beginning work with the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra.</p>

				<p><b>Upper Canada Fiddle Suite<br>John Burge</b></p>

				<p><i>For biographical information on John Burge, please turn to p. 62.</i></p>

				<p>This highly appealing work for string orchestra was commissioned by the Ottawa chamber ensemble, The Thirteen Strings. The group gave the premiere on 18 April 1997 at St. Andrew&rsquo;s Church, with Denis Simons conducting. It has been performed by numerous orchestras across Canada.</p>

				<p>Before the formation of Canada, British colonists referred to what is modern Southern Ontario as Upper Canada. John Burge used the term for the title of this piece to reflect the music&rsquo;s nostalgic, old-fashioned nature. It contains no traditional fiddle tunes. Burge constructed it upon original themes in similar style, with charmingly quirky touches of his own devising added to the mixture.</p>

				<p><i>Reel</i>: The mood and tempo are decidedly upbeat, and the rhythms and dynamics filled with playful surprises. Slides between notes add to the off-kilter good cheer.</p>

				<p><i>Waltz</i>: Here the concertmaster of the orchestra switches to a second violin, one tuned in traditional fiddle style rather than the usual concert manner. This adds an extra touch of piquancy to this languorous, almost surreal movement.</p>

				<p><i>Jig</i>: Burge returns us firmly to earth for a finale whose rollicking energy scarcely flags from first bar to last.</p>

				<p><b>Songs from the Diaspora<br>Roberto Sierra (arr. Boyd MacKenzie)</b></p>

				<p><i>Songs from the Diaspora was commissioned by Music Accord for soprano Heidi Grant Murphy, pianist Kevin Murphy and the St. Lawrence String Quartetand was premiered at Pennsylvania State University on 30 January 2007. For this performance, Boyd MacKenzie has transposed the piece and arranged it for string orchestra. The composer has written the following introduction:</i></p>

				<p>In 1492, a royal decree from Their Catholic Majesties (that was their official title) Fernando de Arag&oacute;n and Isabella de Castilla put an end to the largest and one of the most important Jewish settlements in Europe. The expulsion of these Spaniards who for centuries made important contributions to the arts and the sciences, who were an integral part of the fabric of the Spanish culture, was not only a tragic event for countless people who had to leave the land they called home, but also a great loss for Spain. This politically and religiously motivated expulsion forced the Jews to leave their Sepharad (the term they used for the Iberian Peninsula) and wander to find new places to live. With them they brought their language (Ladino), their music and their poetry. You can still find Sephardic poetry and music, largely unchanged by time, for many wonderful songs have been passed down from one generation to the next through the centuries. Not long ago it would not have been unusual to hear in Sofia (Bulgaria) an old grandmother singing a fragment from <i>De las mares altas</i>.</p>

				<p>In my settings, I selected some of those texts that reflected a sense of longing, and that made references to the Diaspora, as well as some of those that represented aspects of their lives as ordinary people. Many times what has remained is just a fragment of a tune, but in most instances, the lyrics are found in several completed verses. In completing the melodic fragments, I tried to do so in a seamless fashion. When I wrote these songs I wanted to recreate the spirit as reflected in the melodic fragments, and to evoke with the accompaniment a sound world that reflected the beautiful and profoundly moving imagery expressed in the verses.</p>

				<p>The cycle opens with the song titled <i>De las mares altas</i> (From the high seas), which tells the story of how the Queen became jealous of a beautiful girl who came from far away lands dressed in gold and pearls, crowned with sapphires. The next song, <i>Echate a la mar y alcan&ccedil;alo</i> (Go to the seas and find him), originates from Jerusalem and also makes references to the sea, to going away. Here the theme of the wanderer is paired not with exotic imagery but, rather, with the language of daily routines, almost childlike in its simplicity: the water of the ocean becomes the bath water where one is washed, purified.</p>

				<p><i>El rey de Francia tres hijas ten&iacute;a</i> (&lsquo;The King of France had three daughters,&rsquo; from Izmir, Turkey), which resembles many medieval romances, tells the story of the three daughters of the King of France. The song describes how the princesses laboured in the palace, and how one day the youngest one fell asleep while embroidering. As the Queen tries to wake her up, she tells her mother of the beautiful dream she was having, but the Queen quickly explains (perhaps a warning) the symbolic nature of the dream: &ldquo;the moon is your mother-in-law, the star &lsquo;Diana&rsquo; is your sister-in-law, the three birds are your brothers-in-law and the golden pillar is the son of the King, your boyfriend.&rdquo; The mother-in-law as subject is a common thread in the Sephardic tradition, and it could not be more clearly exposed with all its negative connotations (&ldquo;my mother-in-law is stronger than death itself&hellip;&rdquo;) as in the song that follows: <i>Mi suegra la negra</i> (My mother-in-law the evil one), which originates from Filipopolis, modern day Plovdic in Bulgaria.</p>

				<p>The next two songs are from Sarajevo. <i>Camin&iacute; por altas torres</i> (I wandered by the high towers) brings us back to the Diaspora: &ldquo;&hellip;&thinsp;I navigated in lands, where the cock doesn&rsquo;t crow, where nobody knew me. Rain falls from the heavens, tears from my eyes.&rdquo; <i>De que lloras Blanca ni&ntilde;a</i> (Why do you cry, fair child?) also tells us about crying and sadness, but this time it is a girl who is the one that cries for the love that goes away and never comes back. The cycle closes as it opened: with the ocean and a song from Sofia: <i>La Serena</i> (The Siren). In this song the ocean is the world of the siren, that mysterious and mad creature who wants sailors to love her.</p>

				<p><b>Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis<br>Ralph Vaughan Williams</b></p>

				<p>Thomas Tallis (c. 1505-1585) was one of Tudor England&rsquo;s most celebrated musicians. In 1567, he contributed eight themes to the Archbishop of Canterbury&rsquo;s hymn book, the <i>Metrical Psalter</i>. When Vaughan Williams helped edit a new version of the <i>English Hymnal</i> in 1906, he took the opportunity to restore to circulation the third of those melodies. He used it as the tune for the text that begins, &ldquo;When rising from the bed of death.&rdquo; Tallis&rsquo;s lovely, sorrowful theme, set in the antique Phrygian church mode rather than the more common major or minor, moved Vaughan Williams to create a piece based upon it, one that would expand and intensify its inherent qualities. He composed the <i>Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis</i> in 1910.</p>

				<p>Reflecting his studies with master orchestrator Maurice Ravel two years earlier, he richly and ingeniously scored the fantasia for three string groups: solo quartet and two orchestras of different sizes. He used them in strikingly antiphonal ways throughout the fantasia. The music explores a wide range of emotion and texture, from whispered intimacies to bold, compelling grandeur.</p>

				<p>Vaughan Williams conducted the highly successful premi&egrave;re himself, in the vast, imposing space of the thousand-year-old Gloucester Cathedral, on September 6, 1910. His wife Ursula wrote, &ldquo;With the Norman grandeurs of Gloucester Cathedral in mind and the strange quality of the resonance of stone, the &lsquo;echo&rsquo; idea of three different groups of instruments was well judged. It seemed that his early love for architecture and his historical knowledge were so deeply assimilated that they were translated and absorbed into the line of the music.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>That fantasia&rsquo;s premiere, and the debut of <i>A Sea Symphony</i> one month later, laid the foundation of his international reputation. He revised and shortened the fantasia twice before it was published in 1920.</p>

				<p>On the evening of the composer&rsquo;s death, his close friend and superlative interpreter, Sir John Barbirolli, conducted a performance of the fantasia in Vaughan Williams&rsquo;s honour, at a Henry Wood Promenade concert in the Royal Albert Hall, London. A lovelier, more heartfelt tribute would be difficult to imagine.</p>

				<p><b>Il tramonto (The Sunset)<br>Ottorino Respighi (arr. Alain Trudel)</b></p>

				<p>Like almost every Italian composer, Respighi did his duty and wrote his share of operas. It&rsquo;s unlikely, however, that you&rsquo;ll ever have the chance to see a production of <i>Belfagor</i> or <i>The Sunken Bell</i>, good as they may be. Instead, Respighi made his mark as a composer for the concert hall more successfully than any of his fellow countrymen. His colourful and atmospheric style successfully blends elements of Romanticism (in particular the influences of Tchaikovsky, Strauss and Puccini) with the limpid pastel Impressionism of Debussy.</p>

				<p>The young Respighi earned a living as an orchestral player. During his early twenties, he twice traveled to St. Petersburg to serve as Principal Violist in the orchestra of the Imperial Russian Opera. He plucked up his courage and approached his idol, composer Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov. &ldquo;The first time he went to see the Russian maestro, a number of people were waiting to be received,&rdquo; his wife Elsa wrote in her biography of Respighi. &ldquo;Ottorino entered rather nervously and immediately felt intimidated by the imposing figure with the severe glance and icy demeanour. He began to think that he had made a great mistake in disturbing so famous a musician by showing him his scores.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;But to his astonishment, Rimsky-Korsakov rose after skimming through one of the compositions, went to the door leading to the waiting room and said in a loud voice, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see no one else today.&rsquo; The maestro&rsquo;s face had changed; he was almost beaming. Sitting side by side with Respighi, he spent the entire afternoon perusing his scores and asking about his studies and plans. Respighi always cherished grateful memories of the great Russian whom he deeply admired.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Rimsky gave him five months of lessons, focusing on his mastery of virtuosic orchestration. Respighi continued his tutoring with Max Bruch in Berlin. In 1913, he moved to Rome, which remained his centre of activity for the rest of his life. His music&rsquo;s international popularity eventually allowed him to devote his time exclusively to composing and touring to conduct his music.</p>

				<p>He scored his first great success in 1918, when master conductor Arturo Toscanini led the second performance of the tone poem <i>Fountains of Rome</i> (the premiere in Rome the year before had made little impact). Also in 1918, Respighi composed <i>La sentiviva</i> (The Sensitive Plant), a setting for mezzo-soprano and orchestra of a poem by English author Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822). He used an Italian translation.</p>

				<p>Shortly afterwards, during a brief summertime visit to his native city of Bologna, he returned to Shelley&rsquo;s verses and composed a setting of <i>The Sunset</i>, in an Italian translation by Roberto Ascoli. The scoring is for mezzo-soprano soloist and either string quartet or string orchestra. The first performance took place in Rome with Chiarina Fino Savio (to whom Respighi dedicated the piece) as the soloist, and Bernardino Molinari conducting.</p>

				<p>Author Ian Julier describes this rapturous work as &ldquo;an intense and tender reflection on lost love and the splendours of nature. The vocal line is free and declamatory rather than operatic, and reflects the composer&rsquo;s interest in Gregorian chant and the music of Monteverdi. Intimacy and passion are subtly balanced within the work&rsquo;s small frame, making it an especially appealing introduction to Respighi&rsquo;s art.&rdquo; One might add that it is a piece to which the richness and warmth of Isabel Bayrakdarian&rsquo;s voice are ideally suited. Alain Trudel proposes an orchestration that underlines the intimate character of the work and reminds us of the original string quartet version by the many solo passages throughout.</p>
