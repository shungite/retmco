		<h4><div>&ldquo;Right now there is<br>no one like him&ldquo; &mdash; The New Yorker</div></h4>
		<p>We know this. An MCO concert with pianist Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin is unlike any other. Before the show, the anticipation that builds until Hamelin appears is almost unbearable; he mounts the stage and is welcomed rock star style; then, the real excitement begins ...</p>
		<p>For our season-closer, Hamelin will present one of Mozart&rsquo;s finest concertos, written when the master was in peak form. It seems he may have had a little help with his 17th piano concerto from a pet starling &mdash; his fine-feathered friend may have contributed one of the themes to the work. At the very least, the bird enjoyed singing it, but always got one note wrong!</p>
		<p>Hamelin will spend the months leading up to this concert circling the globe performing with other top orchestras, like the Berlin, New York and Rotterdam philharmonic orchestras, and the Melbourne and Chicago symphony orchestras.</p>
		<p><b>Glenn Buhr</b></p>
		<p>Glenn Buhr is a composer, pianist, guitarist, music curator and producer, and band leader. He became well known in Canada in the mid-80s when the Toronto and Montreal symphony orchestras first championed his work, and in the mid-90s as front man &mdash; with conductor Bramwell Tovey &mdash; of the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra&rsquo;s New Music Festival.</p>

				<p><b>Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin</b></p>
				<p>Pianist Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin&rsquo;s unique blend of musicianship and virtuosity brings forth interpretations remarkable for their freedom, originality and prodigious mastery of the piano&rsquo;s resources. A musician of broad musical interests and curiosity, Hamelin is renowned in equal measure for his fresh readings of the established repertoire and for his exploration of lesser known works of the 19th and 20th centuries, both in the recording studio and in the concert hall.</p>
				<p>Last season Hamelin performed Haydn piano concerti with Les Violons du Roy and Bernard Labadie (recorded for release on Hyperion), Beethoven&rsquo;s Piano Concerto No. 4 with the Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich and David Zinman, the Atlanta Symphony and Hugh Wolff, and the National Arts Centre in Ottawa led by Ainars Ribikis. He joined the National Philharmonic of Russia and Vladimir Spivakov for concerti by Rubinstein and Medtner, appeared with the San Francisco Symphony with David Robertson playing Ravel and Gershwin &mdash; and also performed with the Columbus Symphony and the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra. Mr. Hamelin toured Canada and the US performing the Shostakovich Piano Quintet with the Takacs String Quartet and appeared in recital in cities including New York (where he performed the premiere in that city of his Variations on a Theme by Paganini), Chicago, Vancouver, London, Berlin, Lisbon, Munich, Stuttgart, Moscow and Antwerp.</p>
				<p>During the summer of 2012 Marc-Andr&eacute; opened the Aspen Music Festival season with Robert Spano leading the orchestra in Gershwin&rsquo;s <i>Rhapsody in Blue</i> and returned in recital. He also performed in Seattle, Montr&eacute;al, Aix-en-Provence and in Helsingborg, where, in conjunction with serving on the jury of the Edvard Grieg Piano Competition, he performed a recital at Grieg&rsquo;s home, Troldhaugen. In 2012 he opened the season at the BBC Proms with a late night recital of Liszt works and with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. He debuted with Berliner Philharmoniker and appeared with other major symphony European orchestras. In North America, he performed with the orchestras of Chicago, Montr&eacute;al, Qu&eacute;bec and Seattle. He also performed the epic Busoni Piano Concerto throughout the season both in Europe and North America. In recent seasons, Hamelin has performed with orchestra and in solo recital at the Lincoln Center, the various stages of Carnegie Hall and on an international tour of the Schumann Piano Quintet with the Takacs Quartet. </p>
				<p>Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin records exclusively for Hyperion Records. His most recent releases include Reger and Strauss concerti with the Runfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin and a solo disc of works by Liszt; the latter was selected by Bryce Morrison for Gramophone&rsquo;s 2011 &lsquo;Critics&rsquo; Choice&rsquo; feature. An album of his own compositions, <i>Hamelin: Etudes</i>, received a 2010 Grammy nomination (his ninth) and a first prize from the German Record Critics&rsquo; Association. His discography includes concertos and works for solo piano by composers such as Alkan, Busoni, Godowsky and Medtner, as well as brilliantly received performances of Brahms, Chopin, Haydn, Liszt and Schumann.</p>
				<p>Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin is the recipient of a lifetime achievement prize by the German Record Critics&rsquo; Association and is an Officer of the Order of Canada, a Chevalier de l&rsquo;Ordre du Qu&eacute;bec, and a member of the Royal Society of Canada.</p>
				<p><b>Glenn Buhr</b></p>
				<p>Winnipeg-born Glenn Buhr is a composer, music curator and producer, band leader and improvisational pianist. He had his work championed by the Toronto and Montr&eacute;al Symphony orchestras in the mid &lsquo;80s and in the mid &lsquo;90s was front man &mdash; with conductor Bramwell Tovey &lsquo; of the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra&rsquo;s New Music Festival. He was Composer-in-Residence with the WSO and curator of the NMF from 1990 to 1996.</p>
				<p>Buhr has received commissions from many performers and ensembles, including the Montr&eacute;al Symphony Orchestra, the Penderecki String Quartet, the Detroit Contemporary Chamber Ensemble, the Verdi String Quartet, pianist Janina Fialkowska, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, the Toronto Children&rsquo;s Chorus and the Esprit Orchestra. His music has been performed worldwide by such diverse ensembles as the London Sinfonia, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, the BBC Symphony, the National Arts Centre Orchestra, pianist Louis Lortie, pop singer Sarah Slean and soprano Tracy Dahl.</p>
				<p>Buhr performed as soloist at the premiere of his jazz-oriented Piano Concerto No. 2 with the Esprit Orchestra in 2006 and then with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra in 2008. He has toured Canada twice as a jazz artist (pianist/composer) and released his third jazz CD in 2007. He works with novelist / playwright / lyricist Margaret Sweatman as musical director of their group The Broken Songs Band; Sweatman and Buhr won a Genie Award for their song <i>When Wintertime</i> from the film <i>Seven Times Lucky</i>. In 2003 his full-length ballet <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> was premiered by the Birmingham Royal Ballet in Birmingham and has since toured the UK three times for a total of more than 100 performances. It has also toured Hong Kong, Japan and mainland China.</p>
				<p>Dr. Buhr is Professor of Music Composition and Improvisation at Wilfrid Laurier University. He is the founding Artistic Director of the Music in the Ruins Festival at Winnipeg&rsquo;s St. Norbert Arts Centre. His current project is a major new piano concerto for Jan Lisiecki.</p>

				<p><b>Piano Concerto No. 17, in G Major, K. 453<br>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</b></p>
				<p>The Classical period witnessed the first demonstration that the concerto, previously little more than a virtuoso showpiece, could be a meaningful, respectable musical form. Mozart was the key. He raised the concerto to a stature equal to the symphony. The process was naturally a gradual one, and it centred primarily on the piano, the instrument upon which Mozart was best known as a performer (he also played the violin and viola with fully professional skill).</p>
				<p>After an apprenticeship spent creating piano concertos based on themes by other composers (including his boyhood friend, Johann Christian Bach), Mozart created his first fully original piano concerto (known as &lsquo;No. 5&rsquo;) in 1773. His first indisputable masterpiece in this form came four years later. Concerto No. 9, K. 271 is filled with innovative features, such as having the piano enter immediately, rather than follow the standard practice of having the orchestra present the first movement&rsquo;s themes in a lengthy introductory passage. Mozart continued such experiments as his catalogue of piano concertos grew ever richer.</p>
				<p>In May 1781, he was unceremoniously discharged from the service of Hieronymous Colleredo, Prince Archbishop of Salzburg. Delighted to be free from this unappreciative and demeaning relationship, he relocated from the cultural backwater of Salzburg to the bustling musical metropolis of Vienna. The city was ripe for artists with his talent and drive, and before long he was deep into a busy schedule of teaching, composing and performing.</p>
				<p>In a burst of activity characterized by equal parts concentration and innovation, he composed 12 superlative piano concertos between February 1784 and December 1786. They are deeper in feeling, broader in scope and richer in colour than any written before. In years to come, they would serve as models of their kind, ones to which Beethoven, Brahms and other similarly high-minded composers would turn for inspiration.</p>
				<p>The premieres of most of them followed within days of their completion, but this concerto in G Major proved an exception. As he had done with Concerto No. 14, Mozart wrote it for a favourite pupil, eighteen year-old Barbara Ployer. She was the daughter of the Viennese Prince Archbishop Colleredo&rsquo;s agent in Vienna. He completed it on April 12, 1784, and Ms Ployer played the first performance on June 10. Her skill and sensitivity are reflected in every bar. Equally evident is Mozart&rsquo;s understanding of, and love for, woodwinds, a happy carry-over from the recently completed and thoroughly delectable quintet for piano and winds.</p>
				<p>The concerto&rsquo;s opening movement carries an undercurrent of the military march, but one overlaid with a sturdy veneer of gentility. Like all three sections, it embraces a wide variety of moods and episodes. The Andante ranges especially widely, from tenderness to troubled questioning. Mozart clears the air in his finale, a set of variations of a slightly naïve theme, one entirely suitable for a comic opera. He managed to teach it to a pet bird, a starling, that he bought soon after composing it! Mozart&rsquo;s treatment of the theme is anything but na&iuml;ve. It grows in sophistication and exhilaration to climax in a final, dashing Presto.</p>
				<p><b>Divertimento for Strings<br>B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k</b></p>
				<p>The commission for this work &mdash; Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s sole composition for string orchestra &mdash; came from Swiss conductor Paul Sacher. This enterprising and discerning musician requested an impressive number of works, which have earned the stature of twentieth-century classics, thus playing a significant role in making the chamber orchestra a favoured medium of the period. The list of works he requested included music by Igor Stravinsky (Concerto for Strings); Richard Strauss (Metamorphosen); Arthur Honegger (Symphonies 2 and 4); Paul Hindemith (Harmony of the World Symphony); Frank Martin (Petite symphonie concertante); and another, previous work by Bart&oacute;k: Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta. </p>
				<p>In his second commission to Bart&oacute;k, Sacher specifically asked for something shorter and lighter, and Bart&oacute;k agreed to oblige. He composed this Divertimento in August 1939, in the restful retreat of Sacher&rsquo;s Alpine chalet. It was not only the nature of Sacher&rsquo;s request and the ideal working conditions under which Bart&oacute;k composed it that account for its character, but also the overall relaxation and lightening of tone in his music which was already in progress. This trend would continue in further works such as the Concerto for Orchestra and Piano Concerto No. 3. Sacher conducted the Basle Chamber Orchestra in the Divertimento&rsquo;s premiere on June 11, 1940.</p>
				<p>Bart&oacute;k may have had in mind such entertainment-orientated works as Mozart&rsquo;s Classical-era divertimenti when he began the piece. However in terms of style and texture, it turned out to have much more in common with the concerto grosso, a Baroque-era form founded upon the interaction of two bodies of strings, one larger than the other. Folk-inflected dance rhythms drive the Divertimento&rsquo;s bright, appealing outer movements. The slow central movement is much different. Something of the political turmoil of the times may have made its way into it. It displays a strong vein of pathos, underpinned by dark, restless undercurrents.</p>
