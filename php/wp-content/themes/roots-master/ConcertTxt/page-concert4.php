		<h4><div>Winnipeg music icons<br>Earl Stafford and Eric Lussier</div></h4>
		<p>If you attended a Royal Winnipeg Ballet performance between 1984 and 2009, you&rsquo;ve heard Earl Stafford in action. Everyone knows this Winnipeg icon in that connection, but they may not be aware of Stafford&rsquo;s international career as an orchestral conductor. In fact, he has conducted the MCO before, stepping in to conduct <i>The Soldier&rsquo;s Tale</i> in 2013.</p>
		<p>Speaking of iconic Winnipeg musicians, we&rsquo;ve really got two guest conductors for this concert, as Eric Lussier will play / conduct JS Bach&rsquo;s A Major harpsichord concerto (BWV 1055). This wonderful piece likely premiered in 1739 at Zimmerman&rsquo;s coffee-house in Leipzig during Bach&rsquo;s tenure as director of the <i>Collegium musicum</i>.</p>
		<p><b>Eric Lussier &amp; the baroque</b></p>
		<p>Mention the word &lsquo;baroque&rsquo; in Winnipeg, and Eric Lussier&rsquo;s name comes to mind! He was the founding Artistic Director and Conductor of MusikBarock Ensemble which, under his leadership, grew to be a leading musical force in Winnipeg&rsquo;s cultural scene.</p>
		<p>The Manitoba Chamber Orchestra&rsquo;s own music library basically doubled in size when, in 2012, Lussier donated his considerable baroque orchestral collection to the MCO.</p>
		<p>Cheers, Eric!</p>

		  	<p><b>Earl Stafford</b></p>
		  	<p>Earl began his music education at the age of eight, making his debut two years later as piano soloist with orchestra. Since then, he has performed around the world, receiving critical accolades for his performances. The <i>Globe and Mail</i> wrote, &ldquo;His pianistic artistry was sheer poetry.&rdquo; He was awarded the gold medal as best accompanist at the 1980 International Ballet Competition in Varna, Bulgaria.</p>
		  	<p>In 1984, Earl was appointed Music Director and Principal Conductor for Canada&rsquo;s Royal Winnipeg Ballet, a position he held until 2009. Earl has also served as music director for the Saskatoon Symphony, and has held positions on the faculties of the University of Manitoba and Banff Centre for the Arts.</p>
		  	<p>Earl was invited to conduct for Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s Royal Jubilee Gala in 2002 and was music director for the Governor General&rsquo;s Awards with the National Arts Centre Orchestra. He has made numerous recordings for CBC and has appeared as a piano soloist on Bravo and A&amp;E.</p>
		  	<p>Earl&rsquo;s work with the Royal Winnipeg Ballet earned him a sterling reputation, which has resulted in numerous repeat invitations as guest conductor. He has worked with many of Canada&rsquo;s finest orchestras including the Toronto Symphony, the National Arts Centre Orchestra, the Symphonies of Vancouver, Victoria, Kitchener-Waterloo, Winnipeg and Saskatoon and Orchestre Métropolitain. Internationally, Earl has appeared with the Tokyo Philharmonic, the Hungarian State Opera, the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, the Queen’s Hall Orchestra of London and the Theatre Harmony Orchestra of Moscow.</p>
		  	<p>Earl has also collaborated with many of the world&rsquo;s finest artists, including James Ehnes, Janina Fialkowska, Desmond Hoebig, Angela Hewitt, Angela Cheng, Josh Groban, Evelyn Hart, Oscar Peterson, Joel Quarrington, Alain Trudel, Stephen Sitarski, Kyoko Takezawa, Mel Tormé, Ron Paley, Edith Wiens, Mark Zeltzer, Ian Tyson, Neil Sedaka, Fernando Varela, Jann Arden, Anne Murray and more.</p>
		  	<p>Earl is comfortable conducting and playing a variety of musical styles &mdash; from the classics to the avant-garde, and from chamber music to pops. He is a versatile conductor who isn&rsquo;t afraid to take chances.</p>
		  	<p><b>Eric Lussier</b></p>
		  	<p>Eric Lussier has earned an enviable reputation as a virtuoso harpsichordist. A native of Manitoba, Mr. Lussier is a graduate of the University of Manitoba and holds advanced degrees in music from Montreal&rsquo;s McGill University. He has been awarded numerous arts council grants, including a Canada Council grant to study harpsichord with Kenneth Gilbert in Paris. Colin Tilney has been another prominent influence.</p>
		  	<p>A veteran of many national CBC Radio 2 broadcast recitals, Mr. Lussier has played concerts extensively across the nation, from Vancouver to Nova Scotia, including solo appearances with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra, the Alberta Baroque Ensemble, and Tafelmusik. In early 2004, Lussier performed the entire Goldberg Variations for CBC Radio. Mr. Lussier was the founding Artistic Director and Conductor of MusikBarock Ensemble. Under his leadership, the ensemble grew to be a leading musical force in Winnipeg’s cultural scene. He is a faculty member of the Manitoba Conservatory of Music and Arts.</p>
		  	<p>In 2012, he donated his baroque orchestral library to the MCO, collected over 30 years of activity.</p>

			<div class="tab-pane fade" id="notes">
				<p><b>Harpsichord Concerto in A Major, BWV 1055<br>Johann Sebastian Bach</b></p>
				<p>Since the manuscript of this concerto has been lost, it is impossible to determine when Bach composed it. It appears that he created the original version to feature the oboe d’amore. The music has been well-known in his own transcription for harpsichord, which he probably prepared during the 1730s for the Collegium musicum concerts in Leipzig. The manuscript of the harpsichord version has survived, complete with details of the transcription process. From it the original oboe d&rsquo;amore version has been reconstructed and published. This piece is subdued and pastoral in nature. This is particularly true in the slow second movement, which displays the melancholy lyricism of the lilting, rustic dance, the siciliano.</p>
				<p><b>Concerto for Strings<br>Nino Rota</b></p>
				<p>A child prodigy composer, Rota had an oratorio premiered when he was 12. The great Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini dispatched him to Philadelphia for further study. There he made friends with Aaron Copland, destined to be the dean of American composers. Copland introduced him to Gershwin, popular song, and the movies.</p>
				<p>After returning to Italy, the young Rota composed enormous amounts of music, including chamber works and symphonies. Its traditional style impressed everyone except the maniacally contemporary. After World War Two, the avant-gardists looked upon him with increasing horror, especially since he had begun to work regularly in film, a medium which they held in very low esteem. He continued composing concert works, operas and ballets throughout his life. He worked in an approachable, tradition-oriented modern style, and treated every sector of his output with equal respect.</p>
				<p>The year 1952 was a momentous one for Rota, as he began his long-term relationship with the internationally esteemed Italian film director, Federico Fellini. They made 16 pictures together, each one given additional zest by Rota&rsquo;s vibrant, colourful and frequently beautiful music. Their greatest collaborations include <i>La strada</i>, <i>La dolce vita</i>, <i>8&frac12;</i> and <i>Amarcord</i>, each a classic of world cinema. Rota wrote some 150 film scores in total.</p>
				<p>He composed the <i>Concerto for Strings</i>, a refreshing neo-classical piece, in 1964-65, for the distinguished Italian chamber ensemble, I Musici. Its four compact movements present a symphony-like layout of contrasting genres, while offering sufficient opportunities for solo display to justify the title, concerto. The opening movement, <i>preludio</i>, is moderate in tempo and lyrical in character. The second movement, <i>scherzo</i>, is light in tone but not frivolous. To quote author Francesco Lombardi, &ldquo;We enter an atmosphere evoking in turn the dance and a dream celebration, for the music flows along in waltzes and minuets divided by taut, vibrant intervals.&rdquo; <i>Aria</i>, the third movement, brings music that is deeper and more eloquent than the preceding movements, rising to a stark central climax. The circus-like mood of the scurrying, bustling finale draws us close to Fellini territory.</p>
				<p><b>Apollo (Apollon musag&egrave;te)<br>Igor Stravinsky</b></p>
				<p>In the summer of 1927, Stravinsky received his first American commission. The Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Foundation asked for a half-hour ballet, which would be premiered at a festival of contemporary art at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. the following spring. Stravinsky took the opportunity to address a subject which had interested him for some time: &ldquo;to compose a ballet founded on moments or episodes in Greek mythology, plastically interpreted by dancing of the so-called classical school.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>He settled on the myth of the god Apollo and his servants, the Muses, as the subject. Due to the brevity specified in the commission, he reduced the number of Muses from nine to three: Calliope (the Muse of poetry), Polyhymnia (mime), and Terpsichore (dance). The ballet would contain little dramatic action. Seeking an equivalent unity of colour in his music, he chose a string orchestra rather than a full one.</p>
				<p>He composed the score in Nice, France, between July 1927 and January 1928. The premiere took place as scheduled on 27 April 1928, with Hans Kindler conducting. It was produced under the original title, <i>Apollon musag&egrave;te</i>. At the suggestion of the ballet impresario and long-time Stravinsky supporter, Sergei Diaghilev, the composer later shortened the name to <i>Apollo</i>.</p>
				<p>Adolph Bolm&rsquo;s choreography for the first production made little impression. For the Ballets Russes production that debuted in Paris a few months later, Stravinsky asked a brilliant up-and-comer, George Balanchine, to create a different set of dances. Stravinsky conducted the Paris run himself, and expressed deep satisfaction with Balanchine’s work: &ldquo;He had no difficulty in grasping the smallest details of music, and his beautiful choreography clearly expressed my meaning,&rdquo; he wrote. They continued their mutually inspiring collaboration for decades thereafter, on such major scores as <i>Jeu de cartes</i> (The Card Party), <i>Orpheus</i> and <i>Agon</i>.</p>
				<p>Even 15 years after the fact, Parisian audiences of 1928 still thought of Stravinsky as the composer of the barbaric, riot-inducing <i>The Rite of Spring</i>. The chaste beauty of <i>Apollo</i>, one of the defining works of Neo-Classicism, probably startled them nearly as much.</p>
				<p>The first scene shows the birth of Apollo. The offspring of Zeus (king of the gods), and a mortal woman, Leto, he is the god of light, truth and music. The second scene consists of eight contrasting, allegorical dances for Apollo and the three Muses. In them, Apollo presents each of his servants with an appropriate emblem. In the concluding Apotheosis, he leads them off to Mount Parnassus.</p>
				<p><b>St Paul&rsquo;s Suite, Op. 29, No. 2<br>Gustav Holst</b></p>
				<p>Holst was one of the major figures in the school of English composition whose members regularly looked to the country’s rich heritage of folk song for inspiration. The influence of those traditional melodies (and occasionally, as in this work, the authentic articles) can be felt throughout much of his work. Holst divided his early career between playing the trombone and conducting. He later settled into the pattern of teaching and composing that he followed for the balance of his life. He produced a sizeable number of works, including music for orchestra, choral and chamber music and operas.</p>
				<p>His most important teaching post was at St. Paul&rsquo;s Girls&rsquo; School in London. He joined the faculty in 1905, just two years after the institution opened, and he was still a member at the time of his death 29 years later. He wrote this enchanting suite for strings in 1913 for the school’s orchestra, his first work for such an ensemble. He dedicated it to the young musicians who studied with him.</p>
				<p>The four brief movements include several quotations from English folk songs, most prominently in the finale where two Renaissance tunes, <i>The Dargason</i>, and <i>Greensleeves</i>, rub shoulders with great ingenuity. This movement is a transcription and expansion of the last movement of the Suite No. 2 for military band, which he had composed in 1911. In performances at the St. Paul&rsquo;s school under Holst&rsquo;s direction, the students were often instructed to sing the words of Greensleeves, with tambourines brought in at the climax and &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; shouted loudly on the final chord.</p>
				<p>The suite opens with a lively <i>Jig</i> that established the light-hearted, folk-like mood of the entire composition. Its character reflected the traditional Morris Dance tunes that Holst had recently been arranging for military band. The second movement is a soft, swift <i>Ostinato</i> in which the strings are muted to give a special, veiled colour. An exotic traditional Algerian melody appears as the solo violin theme in the third movement, <i>Intermezzo</i>. Its inclusion demonstrated his deep and abiding interest in the music and philosophies of other lands, and the impressions that a trip to northern Africa in 1908 made upon him. For a fascinating and revealing portrait of Holst, watch English filmmaker Tony Palmer&rsquo;s excellent 2011 documentary <i>In the Bleak Midwinter</i>.</p>
