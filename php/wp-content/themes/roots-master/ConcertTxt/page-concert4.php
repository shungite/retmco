		<h4><div>An early Christmas gift<br>&amp; wrapped in baroque music</div></h4>
		<p>What would you like for Christmas?</p>
		<p>How &lsquo;bout Winnipeg&rsquo;s foremost baroque vocal ensemble and &ldquo;Canada&rsquo;s tiny, perfect orchestra&rdquo; conducted by this country&rsquo;s leading interpreter of choral and operatic repertoire?</p>
		<p>Guest conductor David Fallis specializes in the music of the baroque and classical periods &mdash; perfect for this program of festive early music treasures.</p>
		<p>We will hear works from five 17th-century composers &mdash; three of them Italian, one French and one Czechoslovakian.</p>
		<p>Buon Natale! Joyeux No&euml;l! Vesel&eacute; v&aacute;noce!</p>
		<p><b>Curated by a friend, for friends</b></p>
		<p>When you combine the MCO strings with the voices of Canzona in the intimate acoustic splendour of Westminster Church, you get magic! And the magician in charge of this production is none other than local early music specialist Eric Lussier.</p>
		<p>After choosing a selection of instrumental works from the baroque library he donated to the MCO, Eric turned to Canzona&rsquo;s Artistic Director Henry Engbrecht, who recommended that the <i>Zelenka Te Deum</i> close the concert.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I have yet to be disappointed at a Canzona concert ... due in great part to the longtime expert musical direction and unflagging dedication of Henry Engbrecht&rdquo; &mdash; Gwenda Nemerofsky, Winnipeg Free Press.</p>

				<p><b>Canzona</b></p>
				<p>Canzona is a choral ensemble of 16-24 voices and includes many of the leading singers in Manitoba. The ensemble presents two concerts per season and focuses on the masterworks and recently re-discovered works of the Baroque. Canzona has also produced several CD albums, the most recent being a historical project of three CDs consisting of hymns that have been sung entirely in German. This collection (90 songs in all) is a representation of hymns that have been sung in Mennonite congregations across Canada for nearly 100 years. The driving force of the organization is founder Henry Engbrecht, Artistic Director and Conductor. </p>
				<p>Canzona provides a unique opportunity for its audience to witness and enjoy the artistic collaboration between its core of veteran soloists and &lsquo;rising stars&rsquo; &mdash; new and promising singers, youthful apprentices in their studies at university. Canzona is accompanied by musicians of the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra using the name MusikBarock Ensemble under the direction of Eric Lussier (while the Ensemble is no longer operational per se, the long-standing collaboration between our organizations is acknowledged).</p>
				<p>With this concert, the MCO pays tribute to Canzona&rsquo;s 25 years of music-making and wishes them a happy birthday!</p>
				<p><b>Henry Engbrecht</b></p>
				<p>In 1989 a group of enthusiastic singing students asked Henry Engbrecht to conduct a one-time concert of Baroque music. The concert was a success, but at the time no future concerts were planned. A second one-time concert was given in April 1991. A Board was subsequently formed, registration as a not-for-profit charity status was granted in August 1991, and the Winnipeg Baroque Ensemble was born. With the exception of a year of respite (2004-2005) Canzona has presented masterworks of the Baroque in two concerts per season since then. </p>
				<p>Henry Engbrecht was Director of Choral Studies and Activities at the University of Manitoba from 1978-2006, and continued to teach there for two more years. He also conducted the Winnipeg Philharmonic Choir from 1975 to 1990 and the Manitoba Opera Association chorus from 1974 to 1979. Engbrecht has been recognized for his deep involvement in the community, and his contributions to choral music in Canada, by the Manitoba Choral Association, the Manitoba Registered Music Teachers Association, the Association of Canadian Choral Conductors, the Government of Manitoba (with the Prix Manitoba Award) and by the University of Manitoba (through teaching and outreach awards). On April 24, 2012 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters by Providence University College. David Johnson, Executive VP/Provost said, &ldquo;His work in choral studies and with choirs spans decades, from his youth to the present. His work in the church is well-known in southern Manitoba and his choral music is recognized internationally.&rdquo; Henry is now Professor Emeritus at the Marcel A. Desautels Faculty of Music and in 2013 was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Manitoba.</p>
				<p><b>Eric Lussier</b></p>
				<p>Eric Lussier has earned an enviable reputation as a virtuoso harpsichordist. A native of Manitoba, Mr. Lussier is a graduate of the University of Manitoba and holds advanced degrees in music from Montreal&rsquo;s McGill University. He has been awarded numerous Arts Council grants, including a Canada Council grant to study Harpsichord with Kenneth Gilbert in Paris. Other prominent influences include Toronto&rsquo;s Colin Tilney.</p>
				<p>A veteran of many national CBC Radio 2 broadcast recitals, Mr. Lussier has played concerts extensively across the nation, from Vancouver to Nova Scotia, including solo appearances with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra, the Alberta Baroque Ensemble, and Tafelmusik. In early 2004 Lussier performed the entire Goldberg Variations for CBC Radio. Mr. Lussier was the founding Artistic Director and Conductor of MusikBarock Ensemble. Under his leadership, the ensemble grew to be a leading musical force in Winnipeg&rsquo;s cultural scene. He is a faculty member of the MCMA.</p>
				<p>In 2012, he donated his baroque orchestral library to the MCO, collected over 30 years of activity.</p>

				<p><b>Concerto grosso in C Major, Op. 3 No. 12<br>&mdash; &lsquo;Per il santissimo natale&rsquo;<br>Francesco Onofrio Manfredini</b></p>
				<p>Manfredini was one of the many gifted eighteenth-century Italian composers who worked in a variety of cities and towns throughout the country. Born in Pistoia, he undertook his musical studies in Bologna with the eminent composer Giuseppe Torelli. He later resided in several cities, including Ferrara, where he occupied the positions of violinist and director of music for various courts and churches. In 1711, he relocated to Monaco, where he was active as a composer and performer of instrumental music. In 1724, he returned to Pistoia to become director of music at the cathedral, and he remained in that position for the rest of his life. Much of his large output of music has disappeared, including nine oratorios that won considerable success during his lifetime.</p>
				<p>His Opus 3, consisting of 12 concerti grossi for strings, was published in Bologna in 1718. Manfredini dedicated it to Prince Antoine I, his employer in Monaco. The concerto grosso (grand concerto), one of the Baroque era&rsquo;s most popular forms, is founded on the interplay between two bodies of strings: a small concertino (usually two violins and a cello), and a larger group, the ripieno. Two of its major early exponents were Giuseppe Torelli and Arcangelo Corelli. </p>
				<p>This attractive Christmas concerto is the last piece in Manfredini&rsquo;s Opus 3 collection. It opens with a gently lilting siciliano suggesting the peaceful life of shepherds and the quiet joy of Christ&rsquo;s birth. This is followed by a slow, mournful Largo, and an energetic finale. </p>
				<p><b>No&euml;ls pour les instruments<br>(Christmas Melodies for Instruments)<br>Marc-Antoine Charpentier</b></p>
				<ol>
					<li>Les bourgeois de Ch&acirc;tre 1</li>
					<li>Joseph est bien mari&eacute;</li>
					<li>Or nous dites, Marie</li>
					<li>Laissez pa&icirc;tre vos b&ecirc;tes</li>
					<li>Vous que d&eacute;sirez sans fin</li>
					<li>&Aacute; la venue de No&euml;l</li>
					<li>O Cr&eacute;ateur</li>
					<li>Une jeune pucelle</li>
					<li>O&ugrave; s&rsquo;en vont ces gais bergers?</li>
					<li>Les bourgeois de Ch&acirc;tre 2</li>
				</ol>
				<p>French composer Charpentier was best known during his lifetime for his theatre scores &mdash; including incidental music for plays by the renowned writer Molière, plus more than a dozen operas &mdash; and for his sacred choral music. Among the latter type of piece his several settings of the <i>Te Deum</i> (Thou God) text stand out.</p>
				<p>Several French composers of the Baroque period created no&euml;ls, instrumental settings of traditional melodies associated with Christmas. In their settings for organ or harpsichord, French composers of a slightly later time than Charpentier&rsquo;s, such as Louis-Claude Daquin, Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Dandrieu, Claude Balbastre and Nicolas Leb&egrave;gue, used them as points of departure to demonstrate their virtuosity as performers. </p>
				<p>Charpentier adopted a different, more reserved approach. In the no&euml;l settings for instrumental ensemble that you will hear at this concert, he left the melodies virtually in their pristine original state. His contribution was to envelop them in the most delightful and refined of accompaniments. The brief pieces range in character from slow and expressive (<i>Or nous dites, Marie</i>) to quick and joyous (<i>Les bourgeois de Ch&acirc;tre</i>; <i>O&egrave; s&rsquo;en vont ces gais bergers?</i>). He also quoted them in his celebrated <i>Messe de minuit pour No&euml;l</i> (Midnight Mass for Christmas).</p>
				<p><b>Concerto grosso in G Min, Op. 6 No. 8 &mdash; &lsquo;Per la notte di Natale&rsquo;<br>Arcangelo Corelli</b></p>
				<p>Corelli&rsquo;s reputation and influence extended through much of Europe. This Italian musician was one of the leading violin soloists of the Baroque era, as well as a composer of music that is both appealing and historically significant. His sonatas for violin, for example, helped establish this instrument as the most important non-vocal element in music, and he played a major role in establishing the concerto grosso.</p>
				<p>Corelli&rsquo;s Opus 6 (1714), his final published work, is a set of 12 Concerti grossi. No. 8 has long been the best-known of the set. All of the movements except the last present the array of brief sections in contrasting moods and tempos that was typical of the concerto grosso. It is only the soothing, almost lullaby-like concluding pastorale that has specific associations with Christmas.</p>
				<p><b>Introduttiono teatralo in G Major, Op. 4, No. 4<br>Pietro Antonio Locatelli</b></p>
				<p>It was long thought that Locatelli had studied with Corelli, his fellow Italian, but it seems more likely that he was a follower of the older master&rsquo;s style rather than an actual student. He won his first fame as a violinist in Rome, then relocated several times to major cities in northern Italy, Germany and Prussia, everywhere winning high acclaim for his playing. He arrived in the Netherlands in 1729, there to remain for the rest of his life. </p>
				<p>With his probing creative imagination and fearless virtuoso performing style, he served as a model for the later Romantic school of music (ex. Paganini). &ldquo;He plays with so much fury upon his fiddle, that in my humble opinion, he must wear out some dozens of them in a year,&rdquo; wrote an Englishman who heard him play. And the <i>New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</i> says of him, &ldquo;The 12 violin concertos that make up his <i>L&rsquo;arte del violino</i> (The Art of the Violin, 1733) had an immense influence on the development of violin technique, especially in France, where violin teaching continued to bear signs of his style of virtuosity until the beginning of the nineteenth century, and he also left a body of work whose idiom reflects aspects of the most advanced style of the day.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>His twelve Concerti grossi, Opus 1, were published in 1721. In them, he intensified the textures and broadened the colours of the form by adding violas to the concertino. Published in 1735 and dedicated to one of Amsterdam&rsquo;s richest merchants, Abraham Vermeeren, Locatelli&rsquo;s Opus 4 is scored for strings and consists of two parts: six &lsquo;Theatrical Introductions&rsquo; and six concerti. It is unclear if he literally intended the Introductions as preludes to operas, ballets or plays, or as concert works in similar style. They are hybrid works. In form, they follow the pattern of the Neopolitan opera overture, cast in three sections of fast, slow, and fast tempos, but in their scoring for two string ensembles they follow the concerto grosso model.</p>
				<p>The fourth Introduction is a most compact piece, its three movements lasting barely four minutes. The first is brisk and features plentiful interactions between the two sub-groups of the ensemble. The music slips into the minor mode for the slow and thoughtful second movement, to which Locatelli gave the description &lsquo;sempre piano&rsquo; (always quiet). The piece concludes with a joyous, playfully dance-like finale.</p>

				</ol>
				<p>Son of a Bohemian village choirmaster and organist, Zelenka moved from his home town, Louoňvice pod Blaníkem, northwest to nearby Prague to undertake his education at a Jesuit school. The earliest recorded performances of his music date from that period of study. He performed on the violone (the ancestor of the double bass) in service to Baron Hartig, the imperial governor resident in Prague.</p>
				<p>He relocated to Dresden, Germany about 1710, as a member of the Imperial Court Orchestra that was maintained by Augustus (known as &lsquo;The Strong&rsquo;), King of Poland and Elector of Saxony. Some accounts suggest that Zelenka had been forced to leave Bohemia in haste, but no solid evidence has surfaced to confirm that, or to give a reason for his doing so. Between 1716 and 1719 he traveled as far as Italy and Vienna in order to continue his studies. The celebrated composer Johann Fux was one of his teachers in Vienna. </p>
				<p>He then returned to Dresden. In 1723 he provided music (an incidental score to accompany a ‘melodrama&rsquo;) that was performed in conjunction with a significant state occasion: the celebrations that took place in Prague to mark the coronation of Charles VI and Elizabeth Christine as king and queen of Bohemia. It was reported that Zelenka&rsquo;s music (both choral and instrumental) drew higher praise than the compositions that Fux had composed for the same event. </p>
				<p>Johann Heinichen, the music director of the Dresden Royal Chapel, died in 1729. Zelenka took over many of his duties, but when the time came to appoint his official successor, Zelenka was passed over in favour of the hugely popular German opera composer, Johann Adolf Hasse. This choice reflected the court&rsquo;s greater interest in opera than in the liturgical music that had become Zelenka&rsquo;s forte. He received the appointment of Composer of the Royal Court Capelle instead.</p> 
				<p>His profound disappointment with this professional snub resulted in his compositional output falling off markedly throughout the 16 remaining years of his life. A posthumous tribute referred to him as &ldquo;a respectable, quiet, unassuming man, deserving of the greatest respect.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>After his death, his music was guarded carefully by the Dresden Court, which considered it a valuable state asset. It only began to see the light of day again in the 1860s, when the celebrated Bohemian composer Bedřich Smetana introduced one of his orchestral suites in Prague. The real breakthrough didn&rsquo;t come until nearly a century later. During the 1950s, the music began to be published and recorded, which led to it finally receiving the attention and esteem it clearly deserved.</p>
				<p>The majority of his 200-plus compositions are sacred choral works, in which he responded to the texts in consistently sensitive and imaginative ways. His music also displays a thorough mastery of counterpoint (a specialty of his teacher, Fux), the simultaneous combination of multiple musical lines. It earned the admiration of such major contemporary composers as Johann Sebastian Bach (who had his son, Wilhelm Friedemann, copy out part of a Zelenka composition in order to have it performed under Johann Sebastian&rsquo;s direction in a Leipzig church) and Georg Philipp Telemann. It contains numerous unorthodox structures and names, the latter including an instrumental piece that he mysteriously entitled <i>Hipocondrie</i>.</p>
				<p>As a condition for becoming king of Poland, Augustus the Strong had converted to Catholicism. He had a Catholic chapel constructed at the Dresden court. Zelenka was deeply involved in providing it with music, his own and that of other composers. Among the sacred choral works he composed for the king&rsquo;s chapel were two settings of a well-known liturgical text: <i>Te Deum</i> (Thou God). At this concert you will hear the first of them, which he composed c. 1724 (the second, also in D Major, followed in 1731). </p>
				<p>The text dates back as far as the sixth century. No definitive source has yet been determined. The most likely authors are a pair of saints, St. Ambrose and St. Augustine, as well as the Yugoslavian cleric Niceta of Remesiana. It has been sung in a variety of settings: as part of the Matins ceremony, as a processional chant, at the conclusion of liturgical dramas, and as either a song of thanksgiving or a hymn of victory on the battlefield. Musical settings by particular composers date back as far as Palestrina and include versions by Taverner, Lassus, Lully, Purcell, Handel, Haydn, Berlioz, Bruckner, Verdi, Dvo&#345;&aacute;k, Kod&acute;ly and Walton. </p>
				<p>In this <i>Te Deum</i>, Zelenka reused thematic material from the coronation ‘melodrama&rsquo; mentioned above. It has 14 short brief sections: 10 choruses, two solo arias, a duet, and a Gregorian intonation, Salvum fac, which appears at the beginning of the second half, after the consecration of the Eucharist. Much of Zelenka&rsquo;s score is suitably festive and jubilant in nature, with trumpets and timpani bolstering and brightening the texture. He provided contrast through several deeply expressive choruses in slow tempo. The score concludes with an impressive and uplifting fugue. </p>
