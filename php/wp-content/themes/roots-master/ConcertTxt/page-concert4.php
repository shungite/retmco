		<h4><div>An early Christmas gift<br>&amp; wrapped in baroque music</div></h4>
		<p>What would you like for Christmas?</p>
		<p>How &lsquo;bout Winnipeg&rsquo;s foremost baroque vocal ensemble and &ldquo;Canada&rsquo;s tiny, perfect orchestra&rdquo; conducted by this country&rsquo;s leading interpreter of choral and operatic repertoire?</p>
		<p>Guest conductor David Fallis specializes in the music of the baroque and classical periods &mdash; perfect for this program of festive early music treasures.</p>
		<p>We will hear works from five 17th-century composers &mdash; three of them Italian, one French and one Czechoslovakian.</p>
		<p>Buon Natale! Joyeux No&euml;l! Vesel&eacute; v&aacute;noce!</p>
		<p><b>Curated by a friend, for friends</b></p>
		<p>When you combine the MCO strings with the voices of Canzona in the intimate acoustic splendour of Westminster Church, you get magic! And the magician in charge of this production is none other than local early music specialist Eric Lussier.</p>
		<p>After choosing a selection of instrumental works from the baroque library he donated to the MCO, Eric turned to Canzona&rsquo;s Artistic Director Henry Engbrecht, who recommended that the <i>Zelenka Te Deum</i> close the concert.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I have yet to be disappointed at a Canzona concert ... due in great part to the longtime expert musical direction and unflagging dedication of Henry Engbrecht&rdquo; &mdash; Gwenda Nemerofsky, Winnipeg Free Press.</p>

				<p><b>David Fallis</b></p>
				<p>Conductor David Fallis is one of Canada&rsquo;s leading interpreters of operatic and choral/orchestral repertoire, especially that of the Baroque and Classical periods. As Music Director for Opera Atelier he has helped bring that company onto stages around the world. Of particular note are the performances of Lully&rsquo;s Armide which were performed at Versailles, for Glimmerglass Opera in New York and in Toronto in the summer of 2012. Mr. Fallis was also the conductor for Opera Atelier&rsquo;s recent production of Weber&rsquo;s Der Freischütz. Additional credits with Opera Atelier include Purcell&rsquo;s Dido And Aeneas, Handel&rsquo;s Acis And Galatea and Il Pastor Fido, Charpentier&rsquo;s Actéon, Monteverdi&rsquo;s Orfeo, Il Ritorno D&rsquo;ulisse In Patria and L&rsquo;incoronazione Di Poppea, Gluck&rsquo;s Orfeo Ed Euridice and Rameau&rsquo;s Pygmalion. Twice, he has led the Opera Atelier forces on tour to Seoul, South Korea and to Japan, conducting Don Giovanni and Le Nozze Di Figaro. Further conducting assignments for Opera Atelier have included Die Entführung Aus Dem Serail and La Clemenza Di Tito.</p>
				<p>He has led critically acclaimed productions for Houston Grand Opera, Cleveland Opera, Wolftrap Theater, and Utah Opera. On the symphonic stage, Mr. Fallis has conducted Orchestra London, the Windsor Symphony, Symphony Nova Scotia and Symphony New Brunswick. As Artistic Director of the Toronto Consort, a renowned chamber group specializing in the music of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, Mr. Fallis has toured extensively in Europe and Canada and has recorded for Marquis Classics, Dorian and SRI. A musician with great curiosity, he was co-artistic director of Toronto&rsquo;s Metamorphosis Festival, an innovative and multi-cultural three-month-long festival of music, opera, dance, film, theatre and design. In the television and film world, Mr. Fallis has led the Toronto Consort in music for Atom Egoyan&rsquo;s The Sweet Hereafter, and was Historical Music Producer for Showtime&rsquo;s acclaimed series The Tudors, featuring Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Sam Neill and Peter O&rsquo;Toole. Mr. Fallis teaches in the Graduate Department of the Faculty of Music, University of Toronto.</p>
				<p><b>Canzona</b></p>
				<p>Canzona is a choral ensemble of 16-24 voices and includes many of the leading singers in Manitoba. The ensemble presents two concerts per season and focuses on the masterworks and recently re-discovered works of the Baroque. Canzona has also produced several CD albums, the most recent being a historical project of three CDs consisting of hymns that have been sung entirely in German. This collection (90 songs in all) is a representation of hymns that have been sung in Mennonite congregations across Canada for nearly 100 years. The driving force of the organization is founder Henry Engbrecht, Artistic Director and Conductor. </p>
				<p>Canzona provides a unique opportunity for its audience to witness and enjoy the artistic collaboration between its core of veteran soloists and ‘rising stars&rsquo; — new and promising singers, youthful apprentices in their studies at university. Canzona is accompanied by musicians of the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra using the name MusikBarock Ensemble under the direction of Eric Lussier (while the Ensemble is no longer operational per se, the long-standing collaboration between our organizations is acknowledged).</p>
				<p>With this concert, the MCO pays tribute to Canzona&rsquo;s 25 years of music-making and wishes them a happy birthday!</p>
				<p><b>Henry Engbrecht</b></p>
				<p>In 1989 a group of enthusiastic singing students asked Henry Engbrecht to conduct a one-time concert of Baroque music. The concert was a success, but at the time no future concerts were planned. A second one-time concert was given in April 1991. A Board was subsequently formed, registration as a not-for-profit charity status was granted in August 1991, and the Winnipeg Baroque Ensemble was born. With the exception of a year of respite (2004-2005) Canzona has presented masterworks of the Baroque in two concerts per season since then. </p>
				<p>Henry Engbrecht was Director of Choral Studies and Activities at the University of Manitoba from 1978-2006, and continued to teach there for two more years. He also conducted the Winnipeg Philharmonic Choir from 1975-1990 and the Manitoba Opera Association chorus from 1974-1979. Engbrecht has been recognized for his deep involvement in the community, and his contributions to choral music in Canada, by the Manitoba Choral Association, the Manitoba Registered Music Teachers Association, the Association of Canadian Choral Conductors, the Government of Manitoba (with the Prix Manitoba Award) and by the University of Manitoba (through teaching and outreach awards). On April 24, 2012 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters by Providence University College. David Johnson, Executive VP/Provost said, “His work in choral studies and with choirs spans decades, from his youth to the present. His work in the church is well-known in southern Manitoba and his choral music is recognized internationally.” Henry is now Professor Emeritus at the Marcel A. Desautels Faculty of Music and in 2013 was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Manitoba.</p>
				<p><b>Eric Lussier</b></p>
				<p>Eric Lussier has earned an enviable reputation as a virtuoso harpsichordist. A native of Manitoba, Mr. Lussier is a graduate of the University of Manitoba and holds advanced degrees in music from Montreal&rsquo;s McGill University. He has been awarded numerous Arts Council grants, including a Canada Council grant to study Harpsichord with Kenneth Gilbert in Paris. Other prominent influences include Toronto&rsquo;s Colin Tilney.</p>
				<p>A veteran of many national CBC Radio 2 broadcast recitals, Mr. Lussier has played concerts extensively across the nation, from Vancouver to Nova Scotia, including solo appearances with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra, the Alberta Baroque Ensemble, and Tafelmusik. In early 2004 Lussier performed the entire Goldberg Variations for CBC Radio. Mr. Lussier was the founding Artistic Director and Conductor of MusikBarock Ensemble. Under his leadership, the ensemble grew to be a leading musical force in Winnipeg&rsquo;s cultural scene. He is a faculty member of the MCMA.</p>
				<p>In 2012, he donated his baroque orchestral library to the MCO, collected over 30 years of activity.</p>
				<p><b>Sarah Kirsch</b></p>
				<p>Sarah Kirsch (soprano) has been performing with Canzona since 2009. She completed her Masters of Musical Performance at the University of Manitoba Faculty of Music in 2012. She has appeared as soloist with the Southern MB Choral Society, Canzona, MusikBarock and the Winnipeg Philharmonic Choir. In the 2012/13 season she performed with Michelle Mourre&rsquo;s Phoenix Collective and the Little Opera Company — and sang in the New Music Festival, the Cluster New Music and Arts Integrated Festival and the Agassiz Summer Chamber Music Festival. Sarah has also curated a gallery recital featuring five new works for voice and electronic by emerging Canadian composers.</p>
				<p><b>Kirsten Schellenberg</b></p>
				<p>Kirsten Schellenberg (mezzo soprano) has been a member of Canzona since the ‘90s and was a long-time member of The Winnipeg Singers. She performs regularly as soloist for all the leading choral organizations in Manitoba and has enjoyed guest appearances with, amongst other organizations, the MCO and MusikBarock. Her solo work with Canzona in Bach Passions, the B minor Mass and numerous smaller works, has established her as one of Canada&rsquo;s finest mezzos. Last season she was soloist with the WSO&rsquo;s Messiah, the Philharmonic Choir&rsquo;s Elijah, Canzona&rsquo;s St. John Passion and Camerata Nova&rsquo;s Monteverdi Vespers of 1610. </p>
				<p><b>Jan Van Der Hooft</b></p>
				<p>Jan Van Der Hooft (tenor) has been performing with Canzona since 2011. His musical background includes over ten years of Royal Conservatory piano and theory study and a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Vocal Performance from the University of Manitoba in 2011. Since then, he has performed in a wide variety of capacities. Recent solo work includes singing the role of Mayor Upfold in Britten&rsquo;s Albert Herring and performing a comprimario role in Manitoba Opera&rsquo;s Salome. Last season he sang the demanding role of Evangelist in Canzona&rsquo;s performance of Bach&rsquo;s St. John Passion.</p>
				<p><b>Kris Kornelson</b></p>
				<p>Kris Kornelsen (baritone) obtained a Bachelor of Church Music at the Canadian Mennonite Bible College and then a B.Mus. from the University of Manitoba. He has sung both as soloist and chorister with The Winnipeg Singers and Canzona, and has enjoyed guest appearances with, amongst other groups, the MCO, the Mennonite Oratorio Choir and the Winnipeg Philharmonic. With the mixed vocal quartet Encore, Kris sings in a variety of musical styles — from classical to jazz, gospel and pop. He is a Chartered Accountant with Deloitte and a busy family man.</p>
