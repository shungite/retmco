					﻿﻿Guy Few with the MCO<br>&mdash;&thinsp;a Baroque Pageant 
				</div>
			</h4>
			<p>
				Guy Few&nbsp;is not only an outrageously gifted musician, he&rsquo;s also a consummate showman. The press have looked upon his performances with astonishment, proclaiming them &ldquo;simply phenomenal&rdquo; (<em>Le Devoir</em>, Montreal) and &ldquo;sheer brilliance&rdquo; (<em>LA Times</em>). 
			</p>
			<p>
				One probably shouldn&rsquo;t expect Few to don a costume or play two instruments simultaneously at this concert (not unusual tricks for Few), but the program&rsquo;s baroque selections add a dash of extravagance to the event. Bach&rsquo;s second Brandenburg Concerto is widely regarded as among the best orchestral compositions of the period. Presented originally as a gift to an aristocratic military officer, it&rsquo;s also one of the period&rsquo;s most delightfully pompous; a three-movement piece bejewelled with ornamental flourishes and perilously high trumpet lines. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Neruda&rsquo;s E-flat horn concerto, arguably his most significant work, was written at the tail end of the baroque era, and is teeming with infectious, Mozartian melodies. Few will have a lot to dig into. The baroque portion of our evening is rounded off with music by Handel and Corelli.

				Scott is a celebrated Canadian composer, and well known to MCO audiences. The former artistic co-director of GroundSwell has written over forty pieces of classical instrumental and vocal music,which have been presented throughout Canada, the United States, Europe and the former Soviet Union.

									<p>
										<strong>Ritornello (2017)<br>David Raphael Scott </strong>
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>The composer has provided the following note:</strong> 
									</p>
									<p>
										<em>Ritornello</em> is intended as a companion piece to Bach&rsquo;s Brandenburg Concerto No. 2. The second Brandenburg is an example of the Baroque concerto grosso genre, which features the interplay between small and large groups of instruments. A distinctive feature of the second Brandenburg is the use of the high virtuosic trumpet, heard only in the first and third movements. As a marked contrast, the second movement omits both the trumpet and the orchestral accompaniment. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Because the instrumentation for <em>Ritornello</em> does not include trumpet, I turned to the second movement of Brandenburg No. 2 as my starting point. All of the pitch material in this new work is derived from the first six notes of the violin line from Bach's second movement. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Many Baroque concertos make use of ritornello form. In this form, a repeated section of music, the ritornello (literally, &lsquo;the little thing that returns&rsquo;) alternates with freer episodes. I wanted to be true to my source and explore some aspects of Baroque figuration, gesture, technique and, to some extent, harmony and texture. This new work is therefore rooted in this earlier music but develops into a more modern aesthetic as the piece unfolds. The title, <em>Ritornello</em>, refers to the idea of a return: to the wonderful music of Bach as well as my own &lsquo;return&rsquo; to composition after a five-year absence. It is in one movement with three contrasting sections and is approximately 10 minutes in duration. 
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Concerto for Corno da caccia in E-flat Major<br>Johann Baptist Georg Neruda</strong> 
									</p>
									<p>
										This Bohemian (Czech) musician first made a name for himself as a performer on the violin and cello. After spending several years performing in a theatre orchestra in Prague, he moved to Dresden, Germany in 1741 or 1742. He eventually became a violinist in the city&rsquo;s Court Orchestra. Dresden remained the centre of his activities for the rest of his life. Two of his sons, who also studied violin with him, became members of that same orchestra. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Neruda also made his mark as a composer. He created nearly 100 works, some of which were advertised in the catalogues of major publishing houses during the eighteenth century, and many of which are lost. His catalogue of music includes more than 30 symphonies, a variety of concertos, (including 10 for violin), and numerous chamber pieces. His music offers a pleasing mixture of Baroque and Classical period elements, in which sturdy German craftsmanship joins hands with warm Italian lyricism. 
									</p>
									<p>
										This attractive concerto is Neruda&rsquo;s best-known work. Guy Few will be performing it on the instrument for which Neruda intended it, the corno da caccia, a type of hunting horn that preceded the modern orchestral horn. His instrument was built by the Thein company of Bremen, Germany, and is generously on loan to him from the University of Oregon. 
									</p>
									<p>
										The vigorous and tuneful opening movement has a martial tone. Neruda calls upon the soloist to display increasing virtuosity as the movement unfolds. The composer follows it with a noble and stately second movement in which the soloist must produce a lyrical, smooth, almost aria-like sound. The finale is bright and cheerful, with the soloist dancing merrily along. 
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Concerto grosso in G Minor, Op. 6 No. 8, &lsquo;Christmas&rsquo;<br>Arcangelo Corelli</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
										Corelli&rsquo;s reputation and influence extended through much of Europe. He was one of the leading violin soloists of the Baroque era, as well as a composer of music that is both appealing and historically significant. His sonatas for violin, for example, helped establish this instrument as the most important non-vocal element in music. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Although he didn&rsquo;t invent the concerto grosso (grand concerto), one of the Baroque era&rsquo;s most popular forms, he played a crucial role in the establishment of its popularity. It is founded on the interplay between two bodies of strings: a small concertino (usually two violins and a cello), and a larger group, the ripieno. Corelli&rsquo;s Op. 6 (1714), his final published work, is a set of 12 concerti grossi. No. 8 has long been the best-known of the set. All of the movements except the last present the array of brief sections in contrasting moods and tempos that was typical of the concerto grosso. It is only the soothing, almost lullaby-like concluding pastorale that has specific associations with Christmas. 
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Concerto grosso in C Minor, Op. 6 No. 8<br>Georg Frideric Handel</strong> 
									</p>
									<p>
										Handel&rsquo;s first set of concerti grossi&mdash;six pieces making up his Opus 3&mdash;appeared in 1734. He scored them for an orchestra of winds and strings. The 12-concerto Opus 6 collection, in contrast, is written for strings alone. He created it quite quickly, between 29 September and 30 October 1739, aided by heavy borrowings from previous compositions and fueled by a dire shortage of cash. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Baroque scholar Nicholas Anderson has written of them, &ldquo;His Opus 6 concerti were old-fashioned for the late 1730s. In England, however, this was the taste of the time, and although Handel&rsquo;s technique is often similar to Corelli&rsquo;s, in few senses can they be regarded as backward-looking. Indeed, Handel&rsquo;s terms of reference are impressively wide, embracing features of both the suite and of the concerto; but it is, above all, the level of inspiration, the Handelian stamp which is imprinted on every one of these concerti, that assures them of a place alongside Bach&rsquo;s Brandenburg Concerti, establishing the high-water mark of the Baroque concerto. Hand-in-hand with the wide range of Handel&rsquo;s musical idioms is a rich variety of expressive language developed through his experience in the theatre, and often reflecting his own temperament&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;sometimes imperious, sometimes witty, often humorous and always diverting.&rdquo; 
									</p>
									<p>
										Concerto No. 8 is rather dark in sound and character. It has six compact movements. The first and the fifth are examples of character dances, while the others are headed simply with tempo markings. The first movement is a stately court dance, the allemande. Such other major figures of the Baroque period as Bach, Couperin and Purcell composed examples of it. In the fifth movement, Handel offered an example of the lilting, moderately-paced Italian step known as the siciliana. Bach, Vivaldi, Tartini, Alessandro Scarlatti and other Baroque composers wrote examples of it, as did such later figures as Haydn, Mozart, Brahms, Verdi, Stravinsky and Respighi. 
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Baroque Melting<br>Vivian Fung</strong> 
									</p>
									<p>
										Baroque Melting <em>was commissioned by California&rsquo;s San Jos&eacute; Chamber Orchestra, who premiered it in October 2017 with Barbara Day Turner conducting. The composer has provided the following note:</em> 
									</p>
									<p>
										Imagine music &lsquo;melting,&rsquo; an aural experience equivalent to the melting clocks in Salvador Dali&rsquo;s <em>Persistence of Memory</em>, for example. This is the heart of <em>Baroque Melting</em>, in which I take familiar baroque musical ideas and motives, recognizable elements accentuated by the harpsichord, and contort them, bending pitches and phrases out of shape, and then twist them back again into focus. The apotheosis occurs at the end, when a quotation of a Bach chorale, <em>War Gott Nicht mit uns diese Zeit</em>, from his Cantata BWV 14 is warped, ushering the work to its quiet and contemplative ending. 
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Brandenburg Concerto No. 2 in F Major, BWV 1047<br>Johann Sebastian Bach</strong> 
									</p>
									<p>
										Bach arrived in the German town of Anhalt-C&ouml;then in 1717, to take up the position of <em>Kapellmeister</em> to Prince Leopold. This enlightened young monarch not only enjoyed hearing music but was himself a gifted amateur performer on the violin, bass viol and harpsichord. He loved instrumental music more than any other kind, and Bach was only too happy to provide him with many outstanding examples, including his first major outpouring of concertos. The ink would hardly have dried on the manuscript paper before the ensemble of 17 players, which the prince had founded at his court just a few years earlier, would give the premiere. 
									</p>
									<p>
										In 1719, Prince Leopold sent Bach to Berlin, to bring back a harpsichord he had purchased there. During Bach&rsquo;s visit, he made the acquaintance of Christian Ludwig (1677-1734), Margrave (or ruler) of Brandenburg, a town in Prussia. That gentleman asked Bach to send him some examples of his music. 
									</p>
									<p>
										After two years&rsquo; delay, during which Bach composed a good deal of new music, he finally replied to this request. He did so by assembling a set of six concertos for various instruments. The circumstances of their creation have yet to be established conclusively, but it&rsquo;s likely that he had composed some of them for Prince Leopold&rsquo;s ensemble, while others may date to before his arrival in Anhalt-C&ouml;then. After revising and polishing them, Bach sent them off to Brandenburg, a lavish dedication attached. The inscription&mdash;which demonstrates that lengthy, flowery thank-yous to wealthy patrons are nothing new!&mdash;has earned them the nickname Brandenburg Concertos. It reads: 
									</p>
									<p>
										<em>To His Royal Highness<br>Monseigneur<br>Cr&eacute;tien Louis<br>Marggraf de Brandenbourg &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</em>
									</p>
									<p>
										<em>Monseigneur</em> 
									</p>
									<p>
										<em>As I had the pleasure a couple of years ago of being heard by Your Royal Highness, in accordance with your commands, and of observing that you took some delight in the small musical talent that Heaven has granted me, and as, when I took my leave of Your Royal Highness, you did the honour of requesting that I send you some of my compositions, I have therefore followed your most gracious commands and taken the liberty of discharging my humble obligation to Your Royal Highness with the present concertos which I have adapted to several instruments, begging you most humbly not to judge their imperfections by the standards of that refined and delicate taste in music that everyone knows you to possess, but rather to accept, with benign consideration, the profound respect and most humble devotion that I attempt to show by this means. For the rest, Monseigneur, I most humbly beg Your Royal Highness to be so kind as to continue your good grace towards me, and to be assured that I desire nothing more than to be employed on occasions more worthy of you and your service, being with unparalleled zeal,</em> 
									</p>
									<p>
										<em>Monseigneur,<br>Your Royal Highness&rsquo;s<br>most humble and obedient servant,<br>Jean Sebastien Bach<br>C&ouml;then, 24 March 1721</em> 
									</p>
									<p>
										The Margrave showed little interest in the concertos, alas, and they passed, probably unplayed, into a library in Berlin following his death. They were published for the first time in 1850, in an edition marking the centenary of Bach&rsquo;s birth. It took the recording industry to make them popular, beginning in the 1930s with performances by huge modern symphony orchestras. More recent discs and concert performances have given people the chance to hear the Brandenburgs in something like the bright, transparent form that Bach envisioned for them. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Each one has a different set of featured instruments. The solo instruments in the second concerto are flute, oboe, trumpet and violin. Bach divides the solo music among them very democratically, thus creating a rich, varied palette of colours. Displaying a grave, reserved beauty (and omitting the solo trumpet), the central andante provides the perfect foil for the joyous bustle of the outer sections.
