		<h4>A double celebration:<br />The Winnipeg Singers and the MCO</h4>
		<p>Winnipeg was a very different place prior to 1972: there was no Prairie Theatre Exchange, no Manitoba Opera, no Plug In ICA, no Winnipeg Singers and &mdash; horror of horrors &mdash; no MCO!</p>
		<p>At this concert we will celebrate the formation of two of the fine institutions that are the weft and warp of the fabric of Winnipeg’s rich and varied cultural scene.</p>
		<p>The Choir and Orchestra will be conducted by one of Winnipeg’s busiest musicians, Yuri Klaz. Klaz also directs the First Mennonite Church Choir, the Shaarey Zedek Synagogue and continues as conductor of The Winnipeg Philharmonic Choir.</p>
		<p><strong>The Winnipeg Singers</strong></p>
		<p>Being in the same age group, The Winnipeg Singers and the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra are often seen together and frequent the same haunts. In fact, the two groups have performed together more than ten times.</p>
		<p>The Winnipeg Singers consists of 24 trained voices, performing music that spans the times from the Renaissance to the present. The choir frequently commissions new Canadian choral works.</p>

				<p><strong>Yuri Klaz</strong></p>
				<p>Born in Petrozavodsk, Russia, Yuri Klaz earned his Masters in Music degree in conducting before finishing his postgraduate education at the St. Petersburg State Conservatory in 1987. Since 1982 he has been Associate Professor of choral and orchestral conducting at the Petrozavodsk Conservatory and since 1987 has also been the Artistic Director of the Chamber Choir of the Petrozavodsk. Past highlights with this choir have included participation in national (Russia) and international concert tours and music festivals in Germany, Finland, Estonia, Ireland and Norway, with numerous awards being earned.</p>
				<p>In 2000 Mr. Klaz came to Canada to become the Artistic Director and Conductor of the Winnipeg Philharmonic Choir. Quickly becoming a leader in Winnipeg&rsquo;s choral community, he was appointed in 2003 to a parallel role with The Winnipeg Singers and the Shaarey Zedek Synagogue. He also directs the choirs of the First Mennonite Church. In 2005 Mr. Klaz took The Winnipeg Singers on a very successful Asian concert tour, performing in the 6th International Taipei Choral Festival, and then at the 7th World Choral Symposium held by the International Federation for Choral Music (IFCM) in Kyoto — where the choir was one of the featured guest choral groups representing Canada. In 2005 Mr. Klaz made his debut as a conductor with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra to critical acclaim and in 2006 he first performed with the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra. He has appeared regularly with The Winnipeg Singers at the New Music Festival and has led the Manitoba Choral Association choir in rehearsals for many major works. He has also prepared massed choirs for numerous works &mdash; ranging from Handel&rsquo;s Messiah to Shostakovich&rsquo;s 13th symphony &mdash; for both the WSO and the MCO.</p>
				<p>Over the years Mr. Klaz has conducted numerous compositions by Canadian composers such as Sid Robinovitch, Eleanor Daley and R. Murray Shafer. He has also written several articles devoted to the Finnish choral music of the Romantic period focused on the works of Sibelius, Kuula, Mdetoja and Paalmgren.</p>
				<p>Mr. Klaz has regularly undertaken conducting tours in the US, Japan and Russia. In 2010 he received the Winnipeg Arts Council&rsquo;s Making a Mark Award in recognition of excellence in professional practice.</p>
				<p><strong>The Winnipeg Singers</strong></p>
				<p>The Winnipeg Singers, Winnipeg&rsquo;s premier choir, has long been regarded as one of Canada&rsquo;s finest choral ensembles. The choir&rsquo;s mandate is to make a diversity of choral music, performed to the highest standard, accessible to a growing audience. The Winnipeg Singers consists of 24 trained voices, performing music that spans the times from the Renaissance to the present. Each year the choir commissions new Canadian works and premieres other new works for its Manitoba audiences. It presents an annual concert series, engaging some of North America&rsquo;s finest musicians as guests. The Winnipeg Singers have performed joint concerts with such diverse organizations as MusikBarock Ensemble, Winnipeg&rsquo;s Contemporary Dancers, and Les Danseurs de la Rivi&egrave;re Rouge, the Ron Paley Trio and the theatre company Shakespeare in the Ruins. The Singers regularly appear as guests of the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra, and have given concerts and workshops for local social agencies, business firms, and high schools.</p>
				<p>The Winnipeg Singers can trace its origins to a choir begun in the 1930s by composer and voice teacher W.H. Anderson for radio broadcast on the CBC. His choir, known as the Choristers, performed secular music and on occasion offered public concerts. He was succeeded in the 1950s by Filmer Hubble who conducted the group for a national weekly CBC radio broadcast of sacred music called Sunday Chorale. In the 1970s, Dr. William Baerg was asked by the CBC to form a group of singers that would perform concert broadcasts. This choir, the CBC Winnipeg Singers, was devoted to the exploration of both sacred and secular works from all eras and initiated the form of The Winnipeg Singers as it exists today. When the CBC was no longer able to support the choir, The Winnipeg Singers began to produce its own annual concert series, which it has done ever since. Past artistic directors of The Winnipeg Singers include William Baerg, John Martens, Wayne Riddell, Mel Braun, Vic Pankratz, and Rudy Schellenberg. The current Artistic Director, Yuri Klaz, began his tenure with the 2003 / 04 season.</p>
				<p>The Winnipeg Singers are regularly heard on local and national CBC radio. In 1989, they conducted a three-week tour of Austria and West Germany, serving as choir-in-residence at the Classical Music Festival in Eisenstadt, Austria. The Winnipeg Singers performed at the Toronto International Choral Festival in June 2002. In May 2004, the choir performed at the Gala Concert of Podium 2004, the national biennial convention of the Association of Canadian Choral Conductors, held in Winnipeg. The choir travelled to Tawian and Japan in July of 2005 where it was honoured to represent Canada at the 6th Taipei International Choral Festival and at the 7th World Symposium on Choral Music in Kyoto. While in Japan, The Winnipeg Singers also performed in Setagaya, a sister-city of Winnipeg, in Tokyo at the Canadian Embassy and in Kobe for a Symposium sponsored concert.</p>
				<p>The Winnipeg Singers have twice been recognized for their excellence in choral music by the Canada Council with the awarding of the Healey Willan prize. They have released three compact disc recordings, O Praise Ye the Lord and  Prairie Voices, and in 2008,  Swingle Bells. A new recording featuring the music of Winnipeg composer Sid Robinovitch is in production.</p>
				<p><strong>Arvo P&auml;rt</strong></p>
				<p>Estonian composer Arvo P&auml;rt was born in 1935. His oeuvre is generally divided into two periods and he is best known for his more recent works. The early works range from rather severe neo-classical styles influenced by Shostakovich, Prokofiev and Bartok. He then began to compose using Schoenberg&rsquo;s twelve-tone technique and serialism. This earned him the ire of the Soviet establishment (controlling Estonia at the time) and also proved to be a creative dead end, so he immersed himself in studying plainsong, Gregorian chant and the emergence of polyphony in the Renaissance. At the same time he began to explore religion and joined the Russian Orthodox Church.</p>
				<p>The music that began to emerge after this period was radically different. P&auml;rt describes it as tintinnabular: like the ringing of bells. The music is characterized by simple harmonies, often single unadorned notes, or triad chords which form the basis of western harmony. The tintinnabuli are rhythmically simple, and do not change tempo. The influence of early music is clear. Another characteristic of P&auml;rt&rsquo;s later works is that they are frequently settings for sacred texts, although he mostly chooses Latin texts rather than Estonian or the Slavonic used in Orthodox liturgy.</p>
				<p>P&auml;rt has said that his music is similar to light going through a prism: the music may have a slightly different meaning for each listener, thus creating a spectrum of musical experience similar to a rainbow of light.</p>
				<p><strong>Glenn Buhr</strong></p>
				<p>Winnipeg born Glenn Buhr is a composer, music curator and producer, band leader and improvisational pianist. He had his work championed by the Toronto and Montr&eacute;al Symphony orchestras in the mid &lsquo;80s and in the mid &lsquo;90s was front man &mdash; with conductor Bramwell Tovey &mdash; of the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra&rsquo;s New Music Festival. He was Composer-in-Residence with the WSO and curator of the NMF from 1990 to 1996.</p>
				<p>Buhr has received commissions from many performers and ensembles, including the Montréal Symphony Orchestra, the Penderecki String Quartet, the Detroit Contemporary Chamber Ensemble, the Verdi String Quartet, pianist Janina Fialkowska, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, the Toronto Children&rsquo;s Chorus and the Esprit Orchestra. His music has been performed worldwide by such diverse ensembles as the London Sinfonia, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, the BBC Symphony, the National Arts Centre Orchestra, pianist Louis Lortie, pop singer Sarah Slean and soprano Tracy Dahl.</p>
				<p>Buhr performed as soloist at the premiere of his jazz-oriented Piano Concerto No. 2 with the Esprit Orchestra in 2006 and then with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra in 2008. He has toured Canada twice as a jazz artist (pianist/composer) and released his third jazz CD in 2007. He works with novelist / playwright / lyricist Margaret Sweatman as musical director of their group The Broken Songs Band; Sweatman and Buhr won a Genie Award for their song When Wintertime from the film Seven Times Lucky. In 2003 his full-length ballet <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> was premiered by the Birmingham Royal Ballet in Birmingham and has since toured the UK three times for a total of more than 100 performances. It has also toured Hong Kong, Japan and mainland China.</p>
				<p>Dr. Buhr is Professor of Music Composition and Improvisation at Wilfrid Laurier University. He is the founding Artistic Director of the Music in the Ruins Festival at Winnipeg&rsquo;s St. Norbert Arts Centre. His current project is a major new piano concerto for Jan Lisiecki.</p>
				<p>The <e,>Ritchot Mass</em> was commissioned in 1997, a year of major flooding in the Red River valley, by Ontario&rsquo;s Elora Festival. It was premiered that year during the festival.</p>
				<p><strong>Imant Raminsh</strong></p>
				<p>Born in Ventspils, Latvia, Imant Raminsh came to Canada in 1948. After completing an ARCT diploma in violin at the Royal Conservatory of Toronto, and a Bachelor of Music program at the University of Toronto, he spent two years at the Akademie &lsquo;Mozarteum&rsquo; in Salzburg, Austria, studying composition, fugue, violin and conducting, and playing in the professional Camerata Academica orchestra.</p>
				<p>He is the founding conductor of the Prince George Symphony, the Youth Symphony of the Okanagan, NOVA Children&rsquo;s Choir, and AURA Chamber Choir. His compositions have been performed on six continents by such ensembles as the Vancouver, Edmonton, Hamilton, and Toronto Symphonies, the Vancouver Chamber Choir, the Tafelmusik Baroque Chamber Choir, the Tokyo Philharmonic Chamber Choir, the Stockholm Chamber Choir, the Finnish Radio Chamber Choir, Ave Sol (Latvian Chamber Choir), and many others. His music has been heard in such world-renowned halls as Carnegie Hall (New York), Tchaikovsky Hall (Moscow), the Orpheum (Vancouver), Canterbury Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, Notre Dame (Paris) and Santa Maria del&rsquo;Fiore (Florence). Though principally known for his choral works, he has also been venturing successfully into instrumental composition since the 1990s.</p>

			<div class="tab-pane fade" id="notes">
				<p><strong>Credo in E Minor, RV 591<br />Antonio Vivaldi</strong></p>
				<p>Vivaldi landed his first regular job in 1703, taking up the position of maestro di violino at the Pio Ospedale della Piet&agrave;, the largest of Venice&rsquo;s four schools that cared for orphaned, abandoned and indigent children. His responsibilities consisted of teaching the violin, composing instrumental music, and directing its performances.</p>
				<p>In 1713, Francesco Gasparini, the school&rsquo;s composer who was responsible for sacred choral music, took what was initially described as a six-month leave of absence — but he never returned. Until a new maestro di coro was appointed six years later, Vivaldi added composing sacred choral music to his responsibilities. In the same year that he started work at the Pietà, he was ordained as a priest. Composing sacred works thus came naturally to him.</p>
				<p>Each of the Ospadeli had choruses and orchestras recruited from the female residents, boys receiving no musical instruction since they would leave the institutions upon reaching adolescence. The performing standards of these ensembles reached such heights that the local nobility, diplomats, and foreign visitors would crowd the chapels to capacity to hear them perform their regular Masses, Vespers, and Compline services.</p>
				<p>Much of the music they performed was already in existence, but new compositions were also required on a regular basis. They were often given their premieres at major church festivals such as Christmas and Easter. Sacred texts of these works included portions of the Ordinary of the Mass (Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, etc.), psalms, and hymns, as well as secular verses. The secular pieces were often created to showcase the virtuosic and expressive skills of the soloists among the ranks of the chorus.</p>
				<p>Vivaldi contributed to the Pietà&rsquo;s sacred choral repertoire until 1717, when he moved to Mantua. Most of his fifty-odd surviving choral works (he undoubtedly composed more) may be dated to this period, although it&rsquo;s likely that a dozen or so of them appeared during the 1720s and 1730s. Their existence only became generally known in the 1920s, when his personal library of scores was acquired by the National Library of Turin.</p>
				<p>This compact Credo in E Minor is unusual in that the orchestra that accompanies the chorus (there are no soloists) is made up of strings alone, rather than including the wind instruments that were typical during that period. This choice gives it a rather austere quality, matching that of the minor tonality that Vivaldi chose for this piece. He divided the chorus into two halves, allowing for a great deal of impressive antiphonal writing.</p>
				<p>He followed the vigorous opening section Credo in unum Deum (I believe in one God) with the slow, solemn piety of Et incarnatus, (And was incarnate); the affecting lament of Crucifixus (He was crucified); and the renewed animation of the concluding section, Et resurrexit (And rose again).</p>
				<p><strong>Berliner Messe (Berlin Mass)<br />Arvo P&auml;rt</strong></p>
				<p>In the early years of the Soviet Union, cultural bureaucrats permitted composers to follow the bold musical practices of their western colleagues. After the inevitable crackdown, all that remained acceptable was straightforward, optimistic and purely secular music that would inspire the masses to support Communist principles.</p>
				<p>Experimentation took place nevertheless, though usually with harsh results. Major figures such as Shostakovich felt the wrath of official displeasure for the earthy, complex pieces they created during the ‘30s and ‘40s. Decades later, Arvo P&auml;rt&rsquo;s need to express himself honestly, and his deep religious faith, led to his suffering similar repression and denial of opportunity.</p>
				<p>In his initial orchestral work, Nekrolog (1960), he became the first Estonian to employ Arnold Schoenberg&rsquo;s twelve-tone serial method. Credo (1968) was his final piece to use it. It also employed collage, another method which he had recently adopted. In his collage works, he deliberately created jarring results by placing strongly contrasted elements of mood, style and harmony side-by-side.</p>
				<p>P&auml;rt&rsquo;s feeling that he had expressed all he wished to in serial and collage styles led to an eight-year period of almost total creative silence. After immersing himself in medieval and Renaissance music, he emerged in 1976 with a radically different voice. Recreating the eloquent simplicity of the past masters he had studied, his new, ‘tintinnabuli&rsquo; style has earned this modest, quiet, deeply spiritual man a lofty international reputation.</p>
				<p>Commissioned by the Ninetieth Deutscher Katholikentag (German Catholics Day), the Berliner Messe was premiered in Berlin in 1991 in its original version for four solo voices and organ. The version you will hear tonight, for chorus and string orchestra, debuted one year later.</p>
				<p>Restrained nearly to the point of austerity, the Berlin Mass nevertheless communicates deep faith and touching beauty. Between the Gloria and the Credo, P&auml;rt inserted three sections not found in the standardized sequence of Mass movements. First comes a pair of brief Alleluiavers (Allelujahs), then the longest section of this Mass, a delicate meditation on the text Veni Sancte Spiritus (Come, Holy Spirit). Credo (I Believe), the sixth and most animated section, is based on an earlier P&auml;rt work, Summa (1978), composed when profession of faith was outlawed in Estonia. In the revision, P&auml;rt transposed it from a minor key to a major one. Perhaps he intended that the warmer feeling the music gains from this change would celebrate the religious freedom which came into being in his homeland following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Agnus Dei (Lamb of God) concludes the Mass in an atmosphere of haunting, ethereal contemplation.</p>
				<p><strong>Spem in alium<br />Thomas Tallis</strong></p>
				<p>Tallis lived through a period of enormous political upheaval. As a major musical figure (Gentleman of the Chapel Royal) at the sixteenth-century English court of the turbulent Tudor dynasty, he was required to compose music for no fewer than four monarchs, and in nearly the same number of distinct styles: Catholic services for King Henry VIII; English vernacular services for King Edward VI; the reinstated Latin Liturgy under Queen Mary; and both English and Latin works under Queen Elizabeth I.</p>
				<p>It was a mark of his skill, versatility, imagination and practical acumen that he contributed great music to all these traditions. Another factor may have been a genuine (and also perhaps life-saving) personal modesty. &ldquo;As he did live, so also did he die, in mild and quiet sort,&rdquo; read a tribute on the occasion of his death.</p>
				<p>The motet, <em>Spem in alium</em> (I have never placed my hope, with text from the story of Judith in the Biblical Apocrypha) is one of his most impressive achievements. The music of most motets of the period was divided into six separate parts at most. This one has 40, resulting in a vast, intricate intermingling of voices. It embraces a variety of moods, from quietly humble to proudly majestic. Possible inspirations for its creation were, symbolically, the fortieth birthdays of Queen Mary (1556) or Queen Elizabeth (1573). Tallis may also have composed it to rival the several 40-voice works of his Italian contemporary, Alessandro Striggio.</p>
				<p><strong>Ritchot Mass<br />Glenn Buhr</strong></p>
				<p><em>The composer has written the following note:</em></p>
				<p>The first music that I composed while living as a refugee during the 1997 flood was the Kyrie of this Mass. Nursing the grief of losing our home to the flood, I could not help being moved by the opening words of the Mass: Lord, have mercy upon us … I felt that this was a universal prayer for every human being who has ever experienced the suffering of loss. The work is dedicated to those who lost their homes in the disaster, and is named after my community, the Rural Municipality of Ritchot, an area that was brutally devastated by the flood.</p>
				<p>The setting of the Kyrie follows the liturgical model: three statements of the opening text, Kyrie eleison; then three statements of the following text, Christe eleison, and finally three statements of the opening text again. The music unfolds against an ominous drone played by the strings.</p>
				<p>The second movement, Gloria, is joyous noise; a rhythmic celebration of the wonders of this world. Against a steady pulse on a high chord played by the strings, the choir sings the melodies, which are derived from the complex rhythms of the natural accents in the texts.</p>
				<p>In the following movement, Sanctus, the choir and strings perform a long modal melody in three distinct phrases. But the melody is broken up between the sections in the choir: sopranos sing the first note of a phrase and hold it, while the altos sing the second, and so on. So the notes of the melody always overlap, giving the illusion of an echo effect, and the gentle dissonances never resolve until the end of each phrase.</p>
				<p>The final movement, Agnus Dei, borrows its mannerisms from the plainsong chant of the early Christian church. The monastic setting of the opening text swells to a much richer harmonic texture in the course of the three repetitions. Then the same music is played by the strings. The last text of the movement &mdash; dona nobis pacem, a prayer for peace &mdash; is sung by the choir in a quiet cluster of notes. This is followed by glassy sounds on tuned crystal goblets and string harmonics, as the choir shapes its final chord into a restful open consonance.</p>
				<p>This version with added strings was first performed outdoors in the ruins of the St. Norbert Monastery, which is where we lived while our house was being re-built.</p>
				<p><strong>Psalm 121<br />Imant Raminsh</strong></p>
				<p>The music of Imant Raminsh is known for its beauty, melodiousness, and emotional sincerity. &ldquo;I have a limited time to compose,&rdquo; he has written, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m more comfortable saying the things I have to say in a language I already know. I don&rsquo;t have to be original for the sake of being original. That&rsquo;s my very sincere approach.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>He composed this setting of Psalm 121 in 1984. Scored for female chorus and strings, it is music expressing faith and hope, gentle or more rapturous as the text requires.</p>
				<p><strong>Jesu, meine Freude, chorale cantata<br />Felix Mendelssohn</strong></p>
				<p>Mendelssohn composed vast quantities of choral music, ranging in scale from the full-length oratorios St. Paul and Elijah, to a host of shorter motets, cantatas, anthems, and psalm settings. During the winter of 1827/28, he organized a small chorus. Rehearsals took place on Saturdays in the Mendelssohn family home in Berlin, and dealt with, in his words, &ldquo;rarely heard works.&rdquo; The repertoire included portions of Johann Sebastian Bach&rsquo;s St. Matthew Passion. In 1829, the 20-year-old Mendelssohn would conduct the first performance of that mighty work since Bach&rsquo;s death in 1750, thus launching the rehabilitation of the earlier master&rsquo;s reputation.</p>
				<p>Mendelssohn composed several works for his new choir: a motet, Tu es Petrus (You are Peter), and two cantatas: Christe, du Lamm Gottes (Christ, You Lamb of God, which he presented to his sister Fanny on Christmas Eve), and <em>Jesu, meine Freude</em> (Jesus, my joy), which he finished on 22 January 1828. Over the next four years, he composed additional cantatas, all of them linked in some way to his studies of Bach&rsquo;s music. At that time, he was examining the estate of Bach&rsquo;s son, Wilhelm Friedemann (1710-1784), which had been acquired by the father of a friend of his.</p>
				<p>He based both of the cantatas from 1827-28 on chorale or hymn-tune melodies, and cast each of these brief works in a single movement. In <em>Christe, du Lamm Gottes</em>, he scored the accompaniment for full orchestra, while in <em>Jesu, meine Freude</em> he used strings alone. The chorale melodies appear in the soprano section, over an impressive web of imitative vocal and instrumental counterpoint. Two-thirds of the way through <em>Jesu, meine Freude</em>, he shifted from a minor key to major one, at the words <em>Gottes Lamm, mein Br&auml;utigam</em> (Lamb of God, My Bridegroom), dissipating for a moment the clouds that have shadowed the music up to that point.</p>

				<h4>Review:<br />Combined ensembles<br />a musical force to be reckoned with</h4>
				<p class="fineprintdark"><a href="http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/">Winnipeg Free Press</a>, by Holly Harris<br />Manitoba Chamber Orchestra; Yuri Klaz, conductor; The Winnipeg Singers<br />Westminster United Church; Wed, Feb 6<br />Attendance: 858<br />Four stars out of five<br />&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Forty years in the making, the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra and The Winnipeg Singers&rsquo; combined birthday bash proved well worth the wait.</p>
				<p>The two elite musical ensembles are both celebrating their 40th anniversaries all year long &mdash; an impressive accomplishment in a city renowned for its rich culture. To mark the occasion, MCO played host by presenting the vocal ensemble in a celebratory program especially chosen by longtime Winnipeg Singers music director/conductor Yuri Klaz and MCO music director Anne Manson.</p>
				<p>Estonian composer Arvo P&auml;rt&rsquo;s <i>Berliner Messe</i> (Berlin Mass) is the type of music that audiences adore. Originally composed for SATB (soprano, alto, tenor, bass) soloists with organ, its later reincarnation for chorus and strings premièred in 1992. Although technically a 20th-century work, it evokes the austere beauty of Gregorian chant and early music, with its transparent textures leaving little room to hide.</p>
				<p>The 24-voice choir launched into the opening <i>Kyrie</i> with great solemnity, its pungent dissonances melting into consonant harmonies underscored by the strings&rsquo; glassy overtones. The <i>Gloria</i> offered the first taste of the singers performing in full voice, and by <i>Veni Sancte Spiritus</i> &mdash; the very heart of this expressive piece, including its foreboding string drone &mdash; the crowd of 858 was entranced. <i>Credo</i>, with its quickly shifting meters, provided repose before plunging once again into the sombre depths of <i>Sanctus</i>.</p>
				<p>The Singers easily handled the large leaps in <i>Agnus Dei</i>, with the carefully blended a cappella sections a particular highlight.</p>
				<p>The concert also included Canadian composer Glenn Buhr&rsquo;s <i>Ritchot Mass</i>. Written during the province&rsquo;s devastating flood of 1997 &mdash; in which Buhr lost his own home in the RM of Ritchot &mdash; the four-part work is a gem. The composer&rsquo;s imaginative craftmanship distinctly flavours each of its varied short movements based on the liturgical Mass: Kyrie; Gloria; Sanctus; and Agnus Dei.</p>
				<p>The choir&rsquo;s final, hushed intoning of the phrase &lsquo;dona nobis pacem&rsquo; accompanied by their rubbing fingers on tuned crystal goblets filled with water &mdash; thus making art out of potentially destructive forces &mdash; is utter magic.</p>
				<p>Renaissance composer Thomas Tallis probably never dreamed his <i>Spem in Alium</i> (I Have Never Placed My Hope) would be enjoying the success it has today. From innovative art installations to racy bestsellers, the impressive, 40-part motet seems to be everywhere these days. Now augmented by 16 additional guest vocalists, the Singers performed the city premi&egrave;re with controlled precision, despite several nail-biting moments that risked total derailment. Klaz firmly kept the eight independent choirs together as their voices rose and fell through the piece&rsquo;s polyphonic twists and turns.</p>
				<p>The crowd leaped to its feet, clearly appreciative of the work&rsquo;s sheer technical difficulty, as well as all-encompassing sound.</p>
				<p>The concert opened with Vivaldi&rsquo;s <i>Credo</i>, performed with crisp attack and clear diction. By contrast, Latvian-born Canadian composer Imant Raminsh&rsquo;s Psalm 121 is a sonorous expression of faith that melds one phrase into another.</p>
				<p>Mendelssohn&rsquo;s <i>Jesu, Meine Freude</i> closed the decidedly non-secular concert with a joyful noise, as an example of what this versatile, 40-years-young choir &mdash; not to mention its artistic twin, the fine MCO &mdash; does best.</p>
