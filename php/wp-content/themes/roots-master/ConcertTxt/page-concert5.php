		<h4><div>Get your<br>eclectic on</div></h4>
		<p>Guest conductor Judith Yan will have her hands full with Michael Nyby (baritone), Xiao-Nan Wang (Chinese fl ute) and the varied repertoire for this exciting concert of mostly new music.</p>
		<p>Winnipeggers first: composer Jim Hiscott penned the refl ective Far Heavens with musical collaborator Xiao-Nan Wang in mind (aficionados will remember our 2009 performance of Xiao-Nan Wang&rsquo;s <i>Camel Train in the Desert</i>, arranged then by Hiscott.</p>
		<p>Then there&rsquo;s <i>Five enerations &mdash; one house</i>, a piece which composer Julian Grant was inspired to write after receiving a gift of a butterfly harp (yangqin) while living in Beijing. The yangqin led to a guzheng, then a piano led to the strings, which is where we come in!</p>
		<p>An operatic element is introduced when baritone Michael Nyby sings <i>200 Dreams from Captivity</i>, composed by American composer Scott Wheeler. Wheeler, based in Boston, specializes in vocal
		and dramatic music.</p>
		<p><b>Judith Yan can handle eclectic</b></p>
		<p>Judith Yan is currently the Artistic Director of Guelph Symphony Orchestra and the Music Director and Principal Conductor of Opera on the Avalon. She has been a staff conductor for the San Francisco Opera, the Canadian Opera Company and the National Ballet.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The evening&rsquo;s principal hero was conductor Judith Yan, who led this daunting score with astonishing precision and fluency ...&rdquo; (Joshua Kosman, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>).</p>

				<p><b>Xiao-Nan Wang</b></p>
				<p>Xiao-Nan Wang began his study of the Chinese bamboo flute at age 11. He was an instructor at the Department of Music at the Inner Mongolia Normal College where he taught flute, music theory and Chinese folk music history.</p>
				<p>Xiao-Nan immigrated to Winnipeg in 1995, and soon established himself as a master of the Chinese bamboo flute. In 2003, he was invited to appear in the movie <i>The Saddest Music in the World</i>, produced by Guy Maddin, in which he played a talented musician. In March 2004, he performed in a concert sponsored by CBC Radio and the Folk Art Council of Canada, also entitled <i>The Saddest Music in the World</i>. In 2005, the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra commissioned local composer Jim Hiscott to write a concerto for Xiao-Nan. This piece, entitled <i>North Wind</i>, was premiered by Xiao-Nan in the 2006 Winnipeg New Music Festival. Gwenda Nemerofsky, the music critic for the <i>Winnipeg Free Press</i>, commented that &ldquo;Xiao-Nan&rsquo;s performance was the highlight of the evening.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>In the spring of 2007, Xiao-Nan returned to China to complete modifications of the Chinese bamboo flute. He called this new instrument the &lsquo;Chromatic Flute.&rsquo; He would like to record a number of CDs with this new instrument. Xiao-Nan&rsquo;s artistic vision is to explore new musical ideas and create new music for his instrument. He wishes to combine the old and the new, fuse the East and the West, and raise bamboo flute playing technique to new heights. </p>
				<p>Xiao-Nan has since performed with the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra, the Winnipeg Philharmonic Choir, and many other groups. In his private time, he is constantly modifying his flute to suit the music he plays. His newest flute has 10 holes and a mouth-piece. He is anxious to accept students who are interested in learning his art.</p>

				<p><b>&#20116;&#20195;&#21516;&#22530; / Wu Dai Tong Tang<br>(Five Generations &mdash; One House)<br>Julian Grant</b></p>
				<p><i>The composer has written the following note:</i></p>
				<p>During the time I lived in Beijing, from 2007 to 2010, I was bought, as a consolation prize for not mastering Mandarin, a yang-qin (butterfly harp), because I had admired it in a shop window. The sight of such a handsome instrument residing at home, unplayed, was a reproach, and so I got a very rigorous teacher who taught me the basics, so I was able to play duets with her, and later even joined in with a traditional ensemble. Strangely, it is the one stable instrument of a Chinese opera band that probably originated in eastern Europe, as it resembles a dulcimer. For a family birthday, I managed to compose and play a piece for my yang-qin, which I later transcribed for piano. I surrounded the piece with satellite pieces, using similar restricted pitches and textures, rather like Erik Satie&rsquo;s <i>Gymnop&eacute;dies</i>, to create a small suite. The pieces were composed haphazardly and in no particular order. Because I ended up with five, I allude in the title to the strange inedible fruit, that resembles a lemon with five fingers &mdash; or an inflated rubber glove &mdash; that appears at Chinese New Year: <i>Wu Dai Tong Tang: five generations one house</i> &mdash; here, five aspects of the same material.</p>
				<p>Later, I transcribed the whole piece for string quartet, and then reworked the material for this string orchestra version, which incorporates new music from an abandoned orchestra piece. So even though the five movements remain, the string orchestra piece is slightly more varied and dramatic. The original yang-qin piece is the third movement, and the simple song-like material is the basis for the whole work. Only in the fifth piece is there a notable change in tonality, though it is firmly anchored to the whole by an unchanging refrain. The whole piece lasts 15 minutes.</p>
				<p><b>200 Dreams from Captivity<br>Scott Wheeler</b></p>
				<p><i>The composer has written the following note:</i></p>
				<p><i>200 Dreams from Captivity</i> is an orchestral song cycle for baritone with obbligato cello; the poems are by Wang Dan, a leader of the Chinese democracy movement. Written in Chinese and translated into English by Shalin Liu and Scott Wheeler, all but one of these poems was written while the poet was imprisoned for his role in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. The poems are not depictions of life in prison, nor do they explicitly discuss the political issues that brought the poet to this captivity. Rather, this is a series of meditations on memory and friendship, building to a statement of hope in the future. </p>
				<p>The music quotes from two Chinese melodies. <i>Piao ling de luo hua</i> (The faded flowers blowing in the wind) underlies the opening cello solo. <i>The Wild Lilies of Spring</i> is referred to in the poem of that name. Other Chinese references in the music are incidental results of my interest in Chinese music and culture, and have no specific relationship to the text. <i>200 Dreams From Captivity</i> was commissioned through the kind generosity of Shalin Liu. It is dedicated to human dignity and the beauty of spiritual freedom. Much of the work was composed on a generous fellowship from the MacDowell Colony.</p>
				<p><b>Far Heavens<br>Jim Hiscott</b></p>
				<p><i>The composer has written the following note:</i></p>
				<p><i>Far Heavens</i> for chromatic dizi and strings is inspired by Xiao-Nan Wang&rsquo;s spiritual world. It is written for Xiao-Nan&rsquo;s dizi, an instrument that he has transformed from a diatonic bamboo flute to a chromatic instrument made of resin compound. The instrument keeps the many traditional ornaments and glissandi, but adds the extra notes and possibilities of the chromatic scale. There is a feeling of a journey in the piece, although abstracted &mdash; no specific references. The journey is inspired by Xiao-Nan&rsquo;s own life, a path inspired by spirituality, but in physical terms moving through childhood poverty, a rise through the musical hierarchy of the Chinese Army, time spent in Northwest China and Southeast Asia, political tensions in his homeland, moving to Canada, and his devotion through all this to adapting his dizi and music to his new home. <i>Far Heavens</i> was written as part of a Major Arts Grant from the Manitoba Arts Council, and is dedicated to Xiao-Nan Wang.</p>
				<p><b>Serenade for Strings in E Minor, Op. 20<br>Sir Edward Elgar</b></p>
				<p>Numerous front-rank British composers, including Vaughan Williams, Britten, and Holst, have found writing for the rich, expressive and flexible medium of the string orchestra a highly congenial practice. Elgar&rsquo;s contributions were small in number but substantial in every other sense. When fellow composer Herbert Howells asked him for the secret of his understanding of strings, Elgar replied, &ldquo;Study old Handel. I went to him for help ages ago.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>This lovely, warm-hearted Serenade was Elgar&rsquo;s first work for string orchestra. It was followed by the <i>Introduction and Allegro</i> (1905), <i>Elegy</i> (1909), and <i>Sospiri</i> (1914). Its origins appear to lie in three pieces, dating from 1888, the manuscript of which has disappeared. The premiere most likely took place in May 1888, with the Reverend Edward Vine Hall conducting the Worcestershire Musical Union. At that stage, the movements bore titles: <i>Spring Song</i>, <i>Elegy</i>, and <i>Finale</i>. &ldquo;I like ‘em, (the first thing I ever did),&rdquo; Elgar told a friend, Dr. Charles Buck, later that year. </p>
				<p>He revised and re-titled the three pieces in the spring of 1892, in time to offer what he then called <i>Serenade</i> as a third anniversary present to his wife, Alice. The first performance of that version was probably given by the Ladies&rsquo; Orchestral Class in Worcester, an ensemble which Elgar trained and conducted. In later life, he often referred to the <i>Serenade</i> as his favourite among his works. </p>
				<p>The first complete performance by a professional ensemble was given in Antwerp, Belgium in 1896. At first, British audiences greeted the <i>Serenade</i> with indifference. It remained unheard in London until 1906, when Elgar conducted it himself. It has three brief movements, two compact, animated sections framing the heart of the work, a haunting Larghetto. </p>
				<p>Author Michael Kennedy wrote that together with the stirring concert overture, Froissart (1890), the <i>Serenade</i> shows &ldquo;that Elgar was already a master of the orchestra, rare in English music, that he lived and breathed the orchestra as naturally as the air around him, and that, given the spur of the chance of performance in a suitable setting, this kind of music was already within his power.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Words of wisdom from Herbert Howells: &ldquo;Sonority it is &mdash; sonority without noise &mdash; which is the greatest abiding power of the string medium. In a world of sounding brass and tinkling cymbal, and of noise magnified to the nth degree, this is it &mdash; sonority without noise &mdash; that marks the supreme contribution made by string music to the fund of our musical enchantment.”</p>
