		<h4><div>&ldquo;Sharon Bezaly is God&rsquo;s gift<br>to the flute&rdquo;</div></h4>
		<p>High praise from <i>The Times</i> for Israeli flautist Sharon Bezaly, and there’s more. The <i>International Record Review</i> wrote that, &ldquo;Her recordings and concert appearances are typically more than simply triumphs: they are defining artistic events.&rdquo; We get it all, with live performances of two works from her recent recording, <i>Pipe Dreams</i>!</p>
		<p>Bezaly began to study flute at age 11 and at age 14 made her debut with the Israel Philharmonic under Zubin Mehta. She plays on a 24-karat gold flute, built especially for her by the Muramatsu team in Japan, and is known for her perfect control of circular breathing.</p>
		<p>The focus shifts from gold to brass for the second half with Haydn’s &lsquo;Hornsignal&rsquo; symphony, which Anne Manson says was programmed to &ldquo;celebrate the soloists within the MCO.&rdquo;</p>
		<p><b>Pipe Dreams</b></p>
		<p>From the BIS Records site: Another dance, the tango, makes a fleeting and inconclusive, almost dreamlike appearance in <i>Flute Concerto with Tango</i>, which the Uruguayan composer and celebrated conductor, Jos&eacute; Serebrier, has dedicated to Sharon Bezaly. <i>Impresiones de la Puna</i> ... embodies the dream of an eighteen-year-old Alberto Ginastera of finding a truly Argentinean musical language, tracing it back to the indigenous music of the high plateaus of the central Andes, the puna.</p>

		  	<p><b>Sharon Bezaly</b></p>
		  	<p>Described by <i>The Times</i> as &ldquo;God’s gift to the flute,&rdquo; Sharon Bezaly was chosen &lsquo;Instrumentalist of the Year&rsquo; by <i>Klassik Echo</i> in Germany in 2002 and &lsquo;Young Artist of the Year&rsquo; at the Cannes Classical Awards in 2003. <i>Classics Today</i> hailed her as &ldquo;a flutist virtually without peer in the world today&rdquo; and <i>International Record Review</i> stated &ldquo;Her recordings and concert appearances are typically more than simply triumphs: they are defining artistic events.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p>Sharon Bezaly gave her debut concert as a soloist with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Zubin Mehta when she was 14. She then studied at the Conservatoire national superieur de musique in Paris under Alain Marion, Raymond Guiot and Maurice Bourge, winning the Academy&rsquo;s first prizes for flute and chamber music. Subsequently, she was invited by Sandor Vegh to play as principal flautist in his Camerata Academica Salzburg, a position she held until his death in 1997.</p>
		  	<p>Since then, she has become a full-time international flute soloist. As such, she has appeared at the London Proms (with live TV and radio coverage), at the last night of the Welsh Proms, and with all the BBC orchestras. In addition, she has played with the major orchestras of Minnesota, Cincinnati, the Netherlands, Stockholm, Helsinki, Bergen, Gothenburg, Singapore, São Paulo, Rotterdam, Tokyo, Seoul, Malaysia and Osaka. Venues in which she has played as soloist and in recital include the Vienna Musikverein, Tokyo&rsquo;s Suntory Hall, the Rudolfinum in Prague, the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels, Paris’s Salle Gaveau, the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam and Wigmore Hall in London.</p>
		  	<p>Without neglecting the standard repertoire, Sharon Bezaly is a strong advocate for contemporary music and has inspired renowned composers, such as Sofia Gubaidulina and Kalevi Aho, to write for her. To date, Sharon Bezaly has seven dedicated concertos that she performs around the world. She has commented: &ldquo;In recent years my sights have been turning toward a wider horizon and I hope that, by inspiring challenging composers to create new works, it could propel the flute further into the spotlight as well as provide standard repertoire for generations to come.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p>Her flourishing career takes her around the globe, with recent and upcoming tours to Korea, Finland, Spain, South Africa, Argentina, Taiwan, Singapore and Australia. Highlights of the past seasons were the premiere of Jos&eacute; Serebrier’s flute concerto in Carnegie Hall with the composer himself conducting the American Composers Orchestra, concerts with the Estonian National Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Neeme J&auml;rvi, and her participation at the Musica Viva Festival in Sydney.</p>
		  	<p>This season&rsquo;s calendar includes further performances of Serebrier&rsquo;s Concerto for Flute and Tango in Puerto Rico, Mexico, Miami and Winnipeg, as well as invitations to Belgrade (performing Aram Khatchaturian’s Concerto for Flute), Aalborg, Reutlingen, and Clermont-Ferrand.</p>
		  	Her BIS recordings have won her the highest accolades, including the Diapason d&rsquo;or (<i>Diapason</i>), Choc de la Musique (<i>Monde de la Musique</i>), Editor&rsquo;s Choice (<i>Gramophone</i>), CD of the Month (<i>BBC Music Magazine</i>), Stern des Monats (<i>FonoForum</i>), Recommand&eacute; (<i>R&eacute;pertoire</i>) and Recomendado (<i>CD Compact</i>). Her recordings with Residentie Orchestra Den Haag and Neeme Järvi have been honoured as &lsquo;Grammophone choice disc&rsquo; and rated &lsquo;Outstanding&rsquo; by the <i>International Record Review</i>.
		  	<p>Sharon plays a 24-carat gold flute, specially built for her by the Muramatsu team, Japan.</p>
		  	<p><b>Jos&eacute; Serebrier</b></p>
		  	<p>Born in Uruguay of Russian and Polish parents, conductor and composer Jos&eacute; Serebrier is one of the most recorded classical artists in history. He has received thirty-seven GRAMMY nominations in recent years.</p>
		  	<p>When Serebrier was 21 years old, Leopold Stokowski hailed him as &ldquo;the greatest master of orchestral balance.&rdquo; After five years as Stokowski&rsquo;s Associate Conductor at Carnegie Hall, Serebrier accepted an invitation from George Szell to become the Composer in Residence of the Cleveland Orchestra for Szell&rsquo;s final two seasons. Later, Serebrier organized Festival Miami, and served as its artistic director for many years. In that capacity he commissioned many compositions, including Elliott Carter&rsquo;s String Quartet No. 4, and conducted numerous American and world premieres. </p>
		  	<p>As composer, Serebrier has won most of the important awards in the United States, including two Guggenheims (as the youngest in that Foundation&rsquo;s history, at age 19), Rockefeller Foundation grants, commissions from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Harvard Musical Association, the BMI Award and the Koussevitzky Foundation Award. He has composed more than 100 works. His <i>First Symphony</i> was premiered by Leopold Stokowski (who premiered several of his works) when Serebrier was 17, as a last-minute replacement for Charles Ives&rsquo; 4th symphony; later, Serebrier&rsquo;s first recording as a conductor was of that very Ives symphony. Serebrier&rsquo;s music has been recorded by many distinguished conductors, including John Eliot Gardiner. He made his US conducting debut at age 19 with the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, performing his own Symphony No. 2, Partita. His 3rd Symphony, <i>Symphonie Mystique</i>, received a GRAMMY nomination for &lsquo;Best New Composition of 2004.&rsquo;</p>
		  	<p>The French music critic Michel Faure has written a book about Jos&eacute; Serebrier, published by L&rsquo;Harmattan.</p>

			<div class="tab-pane fade" id="notes">
				<p><b>Flute Concerto in G Minor, RV 439, &lsquo;La notte&rsquo;<br>Antonio Vivaldi</b></p>
				<p>Vivaldi was the first Italian composer to make major contributions to the repertoire of the transverse flute (which the player holds sideways, in contrast to the earlier recorder, which was held at right angles to the front of the body). His earliest works for it employed three or more varied solo instruments plus continuo; no strings were involved. He began adding strings to such pieces in the early 1720s. The six flute concertos that were published in Amsterdam in 1729 as Opus 10 were very nearly the first pieces of their kind (only a set of pieces by English composer Robert Woodcock pre-date them). They remain among the most outstanding flute concertos of the Baroque period.</p>
				<p>Vivaldi was also a major contributor to the field of program music, the kind that draws inspiration from elements outside music &mdash; stories, places, works of art, characters, natural phenomena and philosophical ideas. His most famous and beloved work, the set of four violin concertos that makes up <i>The Four Seasons</i>, for example, is a highly detailed exercise in musical description. This concerto (which also exists in several other versions with alternative scoring, including one involving solo bassoon) is another.</p>
				<p>It has several unusual features: six movements, for example, twice the norm for a solo concerto of the period. And Vivaldi himself gave it an overall subtitle, <i>La notte</i> (Night), plus further subtitles for the second and fifth movements. It opens with a quiet, introductory slow movement that casts a spell of foreboding and mystery. The following brief, rapid section is subtitled <i>Fantasmi</i> (Ghosts). Vivaldi portrays them with a darting, scurrying theme. Next comes a pair of short sections without subtitles; the first is slow and expressive, the second light and airy. The music slips into the minor mode for the next section, an eerie, unsettled reverie entitled <i>Il sonno</i> (Sleep). It recycles music from the Autumn concerto from <i>The Four Seasons</i>. The ghosts and their theme return in the vigorous finale.</p>
				<p><b>Flute Concerto with Tango<br>Jos&eacute; Serebrier</b></p>
				<p><i>This attractive piece was commissioned by the BIS record label of Sweden for Sharon Bezaly, who premiered it on tour in Australia in 2009 and recorded it with the Australian Chamber Orchestra, directed by Richard Tognetti. Their performance is available on bis-cd-1789. The composer has provided the following note:</i></p>
				<p>Many of my works open with an introduction, but the first movement of this concerto establishes itself from the first notes with a rhythmic punch not dissimilar in character to the first movement of my <i>Third Symphony</i>. The technical fireworks are interrupted by a lyrical section, which provides a short-lived respite to the trapeze-act virtuoso displays with which the movement ends. The second movement starts with a cadenza of an improvisatory nature, which is followed by a fast virtuoso section, with the orchestra providing encouraging punctuation.</p>
				<p><i>Fantasia</i> is an appropriate title for the third movement, because it doesn&rsquo;t follow a programme, but is more like a rhapsody. Here, the writing for the alto flute takes advantage of the warm, deep sound of the instrument, and provides the soloist with an opportunity to play long, singing lines. There is a highly dramatic section, followed by a slow coda, and this leads into the movement that justifies the title of the work. The idea to leave the tango up in the air, in the middle of a phrase, came from the fact that a &lsquo;true&rsquo; tango almost never has a final chord in the tonic key. If it should have one, this is traditionally played so softly as to be inaudible, and what the listener hears is the forceful dominant chord preceding it. I carried this concept a step further and left the music &lsquo;unfinished,&rsquo; leaving it to the listener to draw his own conclusions. Again, this section provides an interlude of lyrical, slow passages, before soloist and orchestra are again off to the races, ending with a final flourish of pyrotechnics.</p>
				<p><b>Impresiones de la Puna<br>Alberto Ginastera</b></p>
				<p>Ginastera was the finest composer that Argentina has produced. Until the 1950s, such early compositions as the ballet score <i>Estancia</i> showed the strong influence of Argentine folk music (through original themes in folk style, rather than the direct quotation of traditional melodies). Later creations displayed an exciting, colourful, modernist style with less folk flavour to it. It won him a strong international reputation.</p>
				<p>In the late 1940s, a Guggenheim award allowed him to spend time in the US, where he benefited from the guidance of Aaron Copland and other respected musicians. Returning to South America in 1947, he took on several major educational and cultural positions and continued to compose. His catalogue includes three operas, concertos for harp, violin, piano and cello, piano and chamber pieces and choral works.</p>
				<p>Those who met him spoke of a quiet, well-mannered gentleman who looked and dressed like a banker. Copland remarked on &ldquo;the tremendous contrast between the outward personality and the inner man. He is never off the cuff, but speaks always with due consideration for feelings and decorum. He&rsquo;s the last man in the world you&rsquo;d expect to shock people with a sensational opera such as <i>Bomarzo</i>. A lot goes on inside we don&rsquo;t know about, obviously.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Ginastera composed <i>Impresiones de la Puna</i>, a compact and evocative suite for flute and strings, in 1934. He was 18 and firmly in thrall to Argentine folk music. The title refers to the high valleys of the Andes mountains of South America, a cold, dry land lying between 9,000 and 15,000 feet of elevation and shared between Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina.</p>
				<p>The first movement, <i>Quena</i>, takes its name from a vertical notched cane flute that South American aboriginals use to accompany songs, especially the melancholy type known as a yarav&iacute;. Dating back to the ancient Inca culture, the <i>yarav&iacute;</i> was originally a chant that was sung to accompany leave-taking or mourning. In the early nineteenth century it became associated with more romantic situations, such as lost love or the death of lovers. In this movement, Ginastera conjured up an aptly sad mood in gentle music with the flavour of Impressionism. Imitating the quena was one of the inspirations for composing this suite.</p>
				<p>The second movement, <i>Canci&oacute;n</i> (Song) is more animated and melodic. It encloses a yarav&iacute; as the middle section. The finale, <i>Danza</i> (Dance) sets off at a brisk pace, but pauses long enough to present a final echo of the desolate loneliness of the high mountains through an example of another type of aboriginal song, the <i>triste</i>.</p>
				<p><b>Symphony No. 31 in D Major, &lsquo;Horn Signal&rsquo;<br>Joseph Haydn</b></p>
				<p>Haydn&rsquo;s career as a symphonist stretched over a period of 35 years, and came to include more than 100 examples. When he started composing them, during the late 1750s, little distinction existed between multi‑sectioned opera overtures and symphonies written for performance at concerts. Haydn helped chart an independent course for the latter type of piece. He also raised it to the summit of its artistic value. His symphonies pointed the way for later accomplishments in the field, such as the works of a headstrong young man who was his pupil for just a year: Ludwig van Beethoven.</p>
				<p>Haydn composed this delightful symphony in 1765 to celebrate the expansion of the horn section in the private orchestra maintained by Haydn&rsquo;s employers, the imperial Esterházy family, from two players to four. The &lsquo;Horn Signal&rsquo; Symphony &mdash; so nicknamed by Haydn himself &mdash; displays the full range of the horn&rsquo;s capabilities. The four members of the section are featured throughout the work, en masse or in pairs. Haydn also shone the spotlight on solo violin, flute, and cello, but gave the piece as a whole a light texture by omitting trumpets and timpani.</p>
				<p>This is good‑humoured, civilized music in Haydn&rsquo;s most ingratiating style. The first movement opens with the robust call-to-attention of the horn signal, filled with echoes of the hunt and the calls that announced the arrival of the post in Haydn&rsquo;s day. The central development section is quiet and restrained, setting up in cunning fashion the full, commanding return of the horn signal in the final bars.</p>
				<p>Next, Haydn used the separate components of the orchestra with great imagination in a leisurely, warmhearted, slow movement. He put them back together again for the following minuet. The middle section highlights the oboes as well as the horns.</p>
				<p>Instead of concluding the symphony with a typical, racing, comic-opera finale, Haydn offers a gracious theme and variations, a form rarely used as the final movement of a symphony (Beethoven&rsquo;s <i>Eroica</i>, Brahms&rsquo;s Fourth and Dvo&#345;&aacute;k&rsquo;s No. 8 are among the few other examples). The strings introduce the straightforward theme, and the delicious variations showcase numerous orchestral soloists, including double bass. Haydn applies the accelerator only in the coda. He crowns the score with a full return of the horn signal from the first movement, ending the piece as strikingly and festively as it began.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;For those who know the rest of Haydn&rsquo;s oeuvre, stretching away (as it were) towards the distant horizon,&rdquo; wrote the eminent Haydn scholar, H.C. Robbins Landon, &ldquo;there is something peculiarly poignant about the &lsquo;Horn Signal&rsquo; Symphony, whose perfect construction and gay, light-hearted language, as yet untroubled with the ominous accents of &lsquo;Sturm und Drang,&rsquo; represent in some indefinable way Haydn’s farewell to youth; for in the next decades he was never quite able to recapture the deep-seated joy and innocence of this music.&rdquo;</p>
