		<h4>English cellist<br />Colin Carr to play / conduct</h4>
		<p>Colin Carr was the talk of the town in 2011. &ldquo;Everyone loved cellist Colin Carr when he performed with us during the International Cello Festival of Canada last year,&rdquo; says Anne Manson. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be continuing the tradition of having a player rather than a conductor lead the Orchestra.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The program includes a Mozart Divertimento, a Boccherini cello concerto and Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s <em>Souvenir de Florence</em>, which is a beautiful piece that we have wanted to play for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Carr appears throughout the world as a soloist, chamber musician, recording artist and teacher. He has played with most of the major orchestras throughout the world. Colin Carr&rsquo;s cello was made by Matteo Gofriller in Venice in 1730.</p>
		<p><strong>Souvenir de Florence</strong></p>
		<p>The <em>Souvenir de Florence</em> is a string sextet scored for two violins, two violas and two cellos, composed in the European summer of 1890. He dedicated the work to the St. Petersburg Chamber Music Society in response to his becoming an Honorary Member.</p>
		<p>The work, in the traditional four-movement form, received its name after the composer sketched one of the principal themes while visiting Florence, Italy, where he composed <em>The Queen of Spades</em>. The work was revised between December 1891 and January 1892, before being premiered in 1892 (Wikipedia).</p>

				<p><strong>Colin Carr</strong></p>
				<p>Colin Carr appears throughout the world as a soloist, chamber musician, recording artist, and teacher. He has played with major orchestras worldwide, including the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, The Philharmonia, Royal Philharmonic, BBC Symphony, the orchestras of Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington, Philadelphia, Montr&eacute;al and all the major orchestras of Australia and New Zealand. Conductors with whom he has worked include Rattle, Gergiev, Dutoit, Elder, Skrowasczewski and Marriner. He has been a regular guest at the BBC Proms, has twice toured Australia, and has recently played concertos in South Korea, Hong Kong, Malaysia and New Zealand. Mr. Carr&rsquo;s most memorable performances include the Dvořák Concerto to close the Prague Autumn Festival, and Beethoven&rsquo;s Triple Concerto, with Sir Colin Davis conducting, at Royal Festival Hall in London.</p>
				<p>Highlights of the 2011/12 season included Dvo&#345;&aacute;k&rsquo;s Concerto with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, Elgar&rsquo;s Concerto with the Halle Orchestra and a recital of all six Bach Suites at the Wigmore Hall in London. In recent seasons he has performed Beethoven cycles with his duo partner Thomas Sauer throughout the United States and in England, Germany and France. They recorded the complete Beethoven Sonatas and Variations in October 2011. They also recently recorded the complete cello and piano music of Mendelssohn on the Cello Classics label. Colin has played several cycles of the Bach Suites in London, at the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center in New York and the Gardner Museum in Boston. In 2012 in addition to the Wigmore Hall, he will also play them in Toronto, Ottawa and Montr&eacute;al.</p>
				<p>As a member of the Golub-Kaplan-Carr Trio, he recorded and toured extensively for 20 years. He is a frequent visitor to international chamber music festivals worldwide and has appeared often as a guest with the Guarneri and Emerson string quartets and with New York&rsquo;s Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. Recitals take him to major cities each season, with regular performances in London, New York and Boston.</p>
				<p>Colin&rsquo;s GM recordings of the unaccompanied cello works of Kodaly, Britten, Crumb, and Schuller, as well as his Bach Suites, are highly acclaimed. The Brahms Sonatas on Arabesque, with pianist Lee Luvisi, are also favourites. He was the soloist in Elgar&rsquo;s Cello Concerto with the BBC Philharmonic for a <em>BBC Music Magazine</em> recording.</p>
				<p>Colin first played the cello at the age of five. Three years later he went to the Yehudi Menuhin School, where he studied with Maurice Gendron and later William Pleeth. He was made a professor at the Royal Academy of Music in 1998, having been on the faculty of the New England Conservatory in Boston for 16 years. In 1998, St. John&rsquo;s College, Oxford created the post of Musician-in-Residence for him, and in September 2002 he became a professor at Stony Brook University in New York.</p>
				<p>Colin&rsquo;s cello was made by Matteo Gofriller in Venice in 1730. He makes his home with his wife Caroline and 3 young children, Clifford, Frankie and Anya, in an old house outside Oxford.</p>

			<div class="tab-pane fade" id="notes">
				<p><strong>Divertimento in D Major, K 136 / 125a<br />Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</strong></p>
				<p>Ever the practical composer, Mozart never hesitated to write music that was designed solely to entertain. He did so with as much skill and taste as anyone ever has, and without compromising in the slightest his magnificent creative gifts.</p>
				<p>His works in this vein include marches and sets of dances &mdash; minuets, German dances, country dances and so on &mdash; plus serenades, divertimentos, cassations and notturnos. These last terms were virtually interchangeable at the time in referring to light-hearted, multi-movement pieces designed as background music for fancy aristocratic functions, name-days and birthdays, betrothals and weddings, ends of university terms, carnivals and so on.</p>
				<p>Within this area of his catalogue lies a remarkable range of material. Some of it, such as the work you&rsquo;ll be hearing tonight, is as light as a feather. Others, especially the Serenade for winds in C Minor are remarkably sombre. He also created works of virtually symphonic breadth and grandeur in this field, such as the magnificent orchestral serenades nicknamed &lsquo;Haffner&rsquo; and &lsquo;Posthorn.&rsquo; Symphonic indeed — he regularly plucked movements from them to produce concert symphonies. Other large-scale Mozart diversions include the Gran Partita for winds in B-flat Major, and the Divertimento in E-flat Major for string trio, whose richness and breadth belie its fluffy title.</p>
				<p>The sixteen-year-old Mozart composed the set of three divertimenti for strings, of which k 136 is the first, in his native Salzburg during the early months of 1772. He had recently returned from his second trip to Italy. Leopold, his ever-practical, ever-ambitious father, wisely felt that establishing a reputation in that most musical of lands could only enhance the likelihood of his son&rsquo;s being able to develop his miraculous gifts to their fullest and most lucrative degree. Wolfgang arrived back in Salzburg bearing a commission for a new opera, Lucio Silla, which was to be premiered in Milan.</p>
				<p>Why he wrote the divertimenti remains a mystery. He may have planned to take them along on his return trip, hoping like any clever, self-employed entrepreneur that they would (a) bolster his fame, especially since he had taken care to give them gracious, tuneful Italianate features that he felt sure would please that country&rsquo;s music lovers; and (b) remove some of the pressure he felt likely to come his way to write such &ldquo;occasional&rdquo; music during the hectic period leading up to the premiere of the new opera.</p>
				<p>They share two unusual features: each has three movements, rather than the four or more that were typical of a divertimento or serenade; and they are scored for strings alone, rather than the standard mixed-instrument ensemble. Mozart may have intended them to be performed by individual players, as string quartets. It is possible that they are the works that his father, Leopold, offered to the publisher Breitkopf in February 1772 — without success. In recent times they have been played most often by orchestral strings — as this piece will be tonight.</p>
				<p>No record remains of their first performances. One likely possibility is that they debuted in the luxurious private salon of Count Firmian, Governor General of Milan. Mozart had met this generous music lover during his earlier visit. What is known for sure is that Lucio Silla knocked &lsquo;em dead when it first hit the boards on December 26. Twenty further performances followed before Mozart returned to Salzburg in March 1773.</p>
				<p>The D Major Divertimento has another Italianate connection: its succession of movements correspond to those found in the type of overture or sinfonia that introduced operas in Italy during that period. The bright and sunny opening Allegro (quite demanding for the violins) is followed by a warm, songful andante, and a merry, breathless presto.</p>
				<p><strong>Cello Concerto in G Major, G 480<br />Luigi Boccherini</strong></p>
				<p>Equally celebrated as composer and cellist, Boccherini spent most of his life outside his native Italy. In 1766, he embarked on a concert tour that took him first to Paris, where he earned considerable acclaim, then on to Madrid in 1769. He won additional accolades at the Spanish court, where he received the patronage of Infante Don Luis, brother of King Carlos III. He spent the years 1787-1797 in Berlin, as court composer to King Frederick William II of Prussia, himself a good amateur cellist. After the king&rsquo;s death, Boccherini returned to Spain and spent the rest of his life there.</p>
				<p>His music has much in common with Haydn&rsquo;s. Musicologists of the day noticed the resemblance, but having formed the opinion that the Italian&rsquo;s compositions lacked the depth and fire of the Austrian&rsquo;s, they dismissed Boccherini as &ldquo;the wife of Haydn.&rdquo; In a letter that Boccherini wrote in 1798 to Ignaz Pleyel, his Paris publisher, he offered the following more temperate self-appraisal: &ldquo;Everyone who knows me does me the honour of regarding me as a man of probity, honourable, sensitive, good-natured and affectionate as my musical compositions show me to be.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>His numerous chamber music compositions are widely counted his finest creations. Especially valued are the attractive quartets (102 of them) and quintets (125) for strings. In an act of innovation, the latter pieces feature a second cello rather than the more common second viola. The result is music of exceptional tonal warmth and richness. Franz Schubert would use the identical instrumentation in the glorious quintet he composed in 1828.</p>
				<p>Boccherini also composed eleven concertos for cello. All of them date from the early phase of his career, and it&rsquo;s quite likely he created them for his own performances. After he retired from performing during the mid-1770s, he appears to have lost interest in them, making no effort to have them published or circulated. He even left them out of the catalogue of compositions that he had been compiling since 1760 (it was destroyed during the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s).</p>
				<p>For decades, a work known as &lsquo;Boccherini&rsquo;s Cello Concerto in B-flat Major&rsquo; enjoyed regular performances by major artists. It was assembled in 1895 by Friedrich Grützmacher, a German cellist. He drew upon two separate Boccherini concertos, and altered the solo part and the orchestration to bring the piece in line with the musical style of his time. The concerto you will hear at this concert was the source of that piece&rsquo;s lovely second movement. Tonight you will hear that movement in its authentic, original context.</p>
				<p>The Concerto in G Major (known as No. 3 or No. 7 in various editions) was published in Paris in 1770. The bright, sunny opening movement offers the soloist plentiful opportunities for virtuosic display. The pensive, minor-key slow movement calls for a restrained but genuine depth of expressiveness. A merry finale in dance rhythm concludes the concerto.</p>
				<p><strong>Souvenir de Florence (String Sextet)<br />Pyotr Il&rsquo;yich Tchaikovsky</strong></p>
				<p>Most Russian composers of Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s era didn&rsquo;t spend a lot of time writing chamber music. Some, such as Mussorgsky, didn&rsquo;t compose any, while others such as Borodin and Rimsky-Korsakov wrote just a handful of pieces each. Only Anton Rubinstein, the most western-orientated among them, regularly composed abstract works for small combinations of instruments. Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s contributions were small in number but significant in value. The major works were three string quartets, a piano trio, and his final chamber work, this sextet for strings.</p>
				<p>In 1886, he promised the St. Petersburg Chamber Music Society (at whose concerts his three string quartets had been performed) that he would compose a new work for them and dedicate it to them, in return for their electing him an honorary member. The next year he made some sketches for the piece, a string sextet, but a lack of creative energy led him to set them aside.</p>
				<p>In January 1890, he travelled to Florence, Italy, for a working holiday. He composed the opera The Queen of Spades there, in a rapid three months. He also took up the sextet once again, having jotted down a theme for the slow movement in June. After returning to Russia, he completed the sextet in August and gave it the title &lsquo;Souvenir of Florence.&rsquo;</p>
				<p>Composing it caused him considerable difficulty. As he wrote to his brother Modest, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hampered not by lack of ideas but by the novelty of form. There must be six independent and at the same time homogenous parts. This is frightfully difficult. Haydn never managed to conquer this problem, and contributed only string quartets to the chamber music repertoire.&rdquo; He eventually whipped the sextet into a shape that pleased him. After a private run-through in St. Petersburg on 7 December 1887, the public premiere took place three days later. He revised the final two movements thoroughly before the piece was published in 1892.</p>
				<p>Only a small number of string sextets preceded it, including pieces by Boccherini, Spohr, Brahms and Dvořák. This is an exceptionally challenging medium, falling somewhere between quartet and string orchestra. The difficulty of bringing together six equally matched players has resulted in all such works being performed on many occasions by larger groups of strings, as Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s sextet will be at this concert.</p>
				<p>The first movement is the most expansive of the four. It opens abruptly, with a thrusting, energetic theme. The second subject expresses all the yearning beauty for which Tchaikovsky is renowned. The violins introduce the songful theme of the slow second movement, over a pizzicato accompaniment. Solo instruments take their turns in the spotlight as this luxurious, almost balletic music unfolds.</p>
				<p>The second pair of movements is briefer, less ambitious, and adds the flavour of Russian folk music to the score. The outer panels of the third movement offer a sort of melancholy serenade. After a momentary hesitation, the central trio turns into a lively dance. That same feeling powers the vivacious finale. Mid-way through, Tchaikovsky pays homage to western tradition with a passage in fugal style.</p>

							<h4>Review:<br />British cellist<br>a fine finale to excellent MCO season</h4>
							<p class="fineprintdark"><a href="http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/">Winnipeg Free Press</a>, by Gwenda Nemerofsky<br />Manitoba Chamber Orchestra; Colin Carr, guestconductor and cello soloist<br />Westminster United Church; Wed, Jun 5<br />Attendance: 880<br />Four stars out of five<br>&nbsp;</p>
							<p>The Manitoba Chamber Orchestra has an uncanny knack for packing its concert series with some of the most sought-after and talented artists of our time. This past season it has treated Winnipeg audiences to sopranos Isabel Bayrakdarian, Suzie LeBlanc and Tracy Dahl, violinist Karen Gomyo, countertenor Daniel Taylor and pianists Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin and Janina Fialkowska, to name a few.</p>
							<p>Wednesday night marked the MCO&rsquo;s final concert of the 2012-2013 season and they saved something special for last. British cellist Colin Carr was not only the guest soloist, but he was listed as conductor as well.</p>
							<p>Carr is no ordinary musician. He has a joyful aura about him that envelops the audience and draws them into his sensitive music-making.</p>
							<p>He displayed his unique and expressive style in Boccherini&rsquo;s Cello Concerto in G Major, G 480. Carr is one with his cello, made in 1730 by famed Venetian luthier Matteo Gofriller. He plays in an open, honest style, without bravado; he could be playing just for himself. The cadenza of the opening movement revealed a rich tone as he plumbed the range of the cello.</p>
							<p>He was accompanied by a skeleton orchestra &mdash; just two violins, Karl Stobbe and Barbara Gilroy, Dan Scholz on viola and Desiree Abbey on cello.</p>
							<p>The mood shifted radically during the Adagio. Carr crafted it with subtle pensiveness, perfectly complemented by the two violinists. You could have heard a pin drop in the church.</p>
							<p>His cello sang throughout the Allegro, his caressing bow and unstoppable fingers bringing the most out of this cheerfully peppy movement. Carr shows great respect for the music, paying complete attention to every detail the composer has created. This performance earned him a loud standing ovation.</p>
							<p>The evening began with the sunny and melodic Divertimento in D Major by Mozart. The violins and violas stood all evening, which seemed to add more energy to their playing. First and second violins were on opposite sides of the stage, giving the sound an effective dimensional depth. The musicians&rsquo; broad legato phrasing burst with life, full of satisfying peaks and valleys of expression. And while there were some technical inconsistencies with the violin section, the drive and vigour never wavered.</p>
							<p>The Andante was intelligently rendered, with thoughtful phrasing and perfect pacing. Carr, sitting in the cello section, cued gently with head nods and eye contact with concertmaster Karl Stobbe, who showed his trademark reliable leadership.</p>
							<p>The final Presto was a rousing and riveting performance full of conviction and nimble playing by all.</p>
							<p>The audience was predictably wowed by the final work of the evening, Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s enigmatic and dense Souvenir de Florence. It morphs from rich and vigorous, with intensity that can take players over the top, to bucolic, with gorgeous harmonies, all the way to Russian folk-inspired dance.</p>
							<p>The work is unpredictable and complex. The MCO gave it its utmost, with mixed results. Best was the Andante movement, with its melody moving seamlessly from section to section, consistently interpreted with palpable emotion.</p>
							<p>This was a solid way to end the season.</p>
