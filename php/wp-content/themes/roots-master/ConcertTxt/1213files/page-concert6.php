		<h4>Fascinating<br>and thought-provoking<br>family entertainment</h4>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>The music is infectious, joyful, lyrical and very rhythmic.</p>
  		<small>Anne Manson</small>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Two entertaining works will be offered in staged presentations at this concert: Kr&aacute;sa&rsquo;s <em>Brundib&aacute;r</em> will be performed by the MCO and the Pembina Trails Voices children&rsquo;s choir, under the direction of Ruth Wiwchar; and Stravinsky&rsquo;s <em>l&rsquo;Histoire du Soldat</em> is a narrated work.</p>
		<p>Brundib&aacute;r is a children&rsquo;s opera by Jewish Czech composer Hans Kr&aacute;sa with a libretto by Adolf Hoffmeister, originally performed by the children of Theresienstadt concentration camp in occupied Czechoslovakia. The name comes from a Czech colloquialism for a bumblebee.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;<em>Brundib&aacute;r</em> is a terrific piece,&rdquo; says Anne Manson. &lsquo;Ruth had proposed this piece years ago for a collaboration. It&rsquo;s a great story and very empowering for children, who take all the roles in this work. It is emblematic of resisting a fascist leader, but the music is infectious, joyful, lyrical and very rhythmic.</p>
		<p>It is a very important piece to play and to keep playing. I&rsquo;ve done it many times with different children’s choirs all over Europe.&rdquo; This concert is designed for the whole family to enjoy together!</p>

A graduate of Brandon University, Hamelin University (St. Paul, MN) and Memphis State University, Ruth has worked with students in kindergarten through grade twelve, and has been privileged to teach a variety of courses at the University of Manitoba for over thirty-five years. As well as working with Pembina Trails Voices, Ruth has enjoyed working with the children, youth and adults at Westworth United Church where she was the Director of Music for twenty-five years. She has also taught elementary music methods courses with the University of Manitoba and was instrumental in instituting the School of Music&rsquo;s summer Orff Certification Program.</p>
				<p>Currently, Ruth is the Artistic Director of the award winning Pembina Trails Voices, a school division initiated choral program of nine choirs serving the families in the Pembina Trails School Division which is located in the southwest quadrant of the City of Winnipeg. Ruth conducts the internationally known Cantemus, and is co-conductor of PTV Boys and PTV Singers.</p>
				<p>Ruth is the first recipient of the Morna-June Morrow Award for Excellence in Music Education in Manitoba. She was awarded the Winnipeg Branch of the Manitoba Registered Music Teachers&rsquo; Professional Award and was honoured to be named &lsquo;Most Outstanding Director&rsquo; at the Young Prague Festival in 2006. In 2010, Ruth was presented with the Carl Orff Canada Special certificate “in appreciation of her dedication and outstanding work In the field of choral music and the leadership she has given to Canadian music educators.” The Manitoba Foundation for the Arts honoured Ruth by presenting her with the Lee Cameron Arts in Education Award.</p>
				<p>Ruth has served on the National Board of Carl Orff Canada, is the Past President of the Manitoba Choral Association, was a member of the committee that produced the United Church hymnal, Voices United and is active on the United Church&rsquo;s Winnipeg Presbytery Worship Committee. Ruth and her husband Dan have two grown sons, Stephen (Lisa), and Michael (Mara), and are enjoying two recent additions to their family, Reese and Jackson.</p>
				<p><strong>Pembina Trails Voices</strong></p>
				<p>Pembina Trails Voices is one of the premier youth and children&rsquo;s choral ensembles in Canada. The choir&rsquo;s roots were firmly planted in the former Assiniboine South School Division when, in 1981, two ASSD trustees, Verna Van Roon and Myrtle Zimmerman, approached music educator Jan Bratland with a proposal to form a choir to entertain at the annual provincial trustees meetings in Brandon.</p>
				<p>The choir did a fabulous job of performing for the assembled throng. They had such a wonderful time together that they refused to disband! In short order, members of the choir appealed to the school board to fund the continuation of the choir, and the board agreed. With support from Dr. Patrick Krescy, Assistant Superintendent, the Assiniboine South School Division, and led by Jan Bratland, this choir became known as the Assiniboine South Youth Choir, comprised of choristers from grade five through nine. They rehearsed once a week, presented two concerts a year and toured in the spring.</p>
				<p>In 1986, Dr. Garry Froese began his tenure with the choir and, within five years, added a girl choir and boy choir component within the structure of twice-weekly rehearsals. Throughout the years, various other ensembles branched out from ASYC, giving the choristers a myriad of vocal and choral opportunities.</p>
				<p>In 2002, Ruth Wiwchar joined the Assiniboine South School Division and was appointed Artistic Director of the Youth Choir. That same year the Assiniboine South and the Fort Garry School Divisions amalgamated to become the Pembina Trails School Division. The youth choir followed suit, changing the name to Pembina Trails Voices.</p>
				<p>With amalgamation came the opportunity for the choir to expand, both in the number of ensembles and in the number of choristers. Today, PTV is comprised of choristers from K through grade twelve and functions in a series of ensembles, reflecting the various stages of vocal and musical development. The choir currently presents a total of five major concerts a year.</p>
				<p>Touring is an integral part of the program for middle and senior years choristers. Sharing choral music with audiences throughout Canada, the United States, the Caribbean and Europe has brought an incredible richness and a depth of cultural awareness to the choristers. Touring highlights over the years include performing in Newfoundland, Prague, Vienna, and at New York&rsquo;s Carnegie Hall.</p>

				<p><strong>Brundib&aacute;r (The Bumblebee)<br>Hans Kr&aacute;sa</strong></p>
				<p>Born in Prague of German descent, Kr&aacute;sa, like many other Jewish artists, perished in the Nazi Holocaust. His tragically brief career knew its share of success, and promised even more. In 1927, when he was 28, one of his teachers, the esteemed composer / conductor Alexander Zemlinsky, helped promote Kr&aacute;sa&rsquo;s conducting career by taking him along to Berlin as his assistant at the Kroll Opera. By that time, Kr&aacute;sa&rsquo;s Symphony for Small Orchestra had already won a favourable reception in Zurich, Boston and New York. He received conducting offers from Berlin, Paris, and Chicago, but since he was unwilling to accept a post in a foreign country, he returned to Prague. He threw himself into multiple activities, including composing his first opera, <em>Verlobung im Traum</em> (Betrothal in a Dream, 1933, from a story by the celebrated Russian author, Fyodor Dostoyevsky). It was produced in Prague under the esteemed conductor, George Szell.</p>
				<p>Because Kr&aacute;sa was Jewish and a vocal anti-fascist, in August 1942 he was sent to the Terezín (Theresienstadt) facility near Prague, a transitional location for people destined for the death camps. The Nazis tried to disguise it as a pleasant place to stay, prettifying it for a visit by a Red Cross representative in June 1944, for example.</p>
				<p>At first, the Terezín authorities merely tolerated artistic activity, but eventually they encouraged it. Kr&aacute;sa composed several works there, and served as music director of a group that administered the inmates&rsquo; &lsquo;leisure&rsquo; time. On 16 October 1944, he was sent on to the Auschwitz camp, where he was murdered in the gas chambers two days later.</p>
				<p>His music displays a heady mixture of many contemporary trends, from Zemlinsky&rsquo;s late Romanticism to the expressionism of Schoenberg, the neo-classical style of Stravinsky, and Debussy&rsquo;s French impressionism. It contained, to quote the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, &ldquo;subversive humour, grotesque gestures, formal confidence and melodic lyricism.&rdquo; He himself said, &ldquo;I am sufficiently daring, as a modern composer, to write melodic music. This reflects my whole attitude to music, whether it is called modern or anything else. My music is strictly founded on the concept of accessible melodic character.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Naturally for a composer who lived just 44 years, his catalogue is small. It includes chamber works, an Overture for small orchestra, and songs. For decades, his music, like that of other composers who fell victim to the Nazis, appeared to have died with him. In the mid-1980s, it began to resurface, leading to its first widespread appreciation.</p>
				<p>In 1934, Kr&aacute;sa composed incidental music for author Adolf Hoffmeister&rsquo;s play, Youth in Play. Four years later, when the Czech Ministry of Education and Culture sponsored a competition for a children&rsquo;s opera, Kr&aacute;sa and Hoffmeister continued their collaboration with <em>Brundib&aacute;r</em>. Not long after it had been completed, the Nazis invaded the country. Jewish art was forbidden from public performance, so the occupants of Prague&rsquo;s Jewish ghetto staged private performances in their homes and institutions. In 1942, <em>Brundib&aacute;r</em> was performed by the residents of one such place, the Prague Jewish Boys&rsquo; Orphanage. After three performances, the entire population of the orphanage, children and staff alike, was shipped to the camps.</p>
				<p>By that time, Kr&aacute;sa had already been sent to Terezín. The residents of the orphanage ended up there, too. One of the orphanage&rsquo;s staff members had hidden a piano / vocal score of <em>Brundib&aacute;r</em> in his luggage. He gave it to Kr&aacute;sa, who reconstructed the accompaniment for the instrumental forces that were available, a chamber orchestra of thirteen.</p>
				<p><em>Brundib&aacute;r</em> received no fewer than 55 performances in the camp, beginning on 23 September 1943. The Nazis recognized the usefulness of this situation as propaganda, to show how &lsquo;well&rsquo; they were treating the inmates. The outside world heard only about the delightful performances by the children of the camp, excerpts from one of which were released on film. The world was unaware that the cast had to be replenished constantly, as virtually all the children who performed in the opera were exterminated shortly after they did so.</p>
				<p><em>Brundib&aacute;r</em> was published in 1992, and has received numerous performances in many lands. On one level, the engaging music and story provide pleasant family entertainment. On another, echoes of the heart-piercing circumstances under which it was first performed, and its stirring messages of hope, cooperation, and the defiance of evil (embodied in <em>Brundib&aacute;r</em>, the Hitler-like organ grinder), give it much different and deeper resonance. This MCO performance uses an English-language text by the noted British opera director, John Abulafia. His production of <em>Brundib&aacute;r</em> for the Mecklenburg Opera Company, conducted by Anne Manson, was broadcast by the BBC in 1993.</p>
				<p>Scene 1 : Two children, Aninka and Pep&iacute;&#269;ek, have a sick mother, who needs milk to get better. They have no money to buy it from the milkman, so they decide to imitate the wicked, bullying organ-grinder, Brundib&aacute;r, and raise money by singing on a street corner. Brundib&aacute;r and a policeman chase them away. The children spend the night on a bench. A dog, a cat, and a sparrow offer to help them.</p>
				<p>Scene 2 : In the morning, the children and their friends, animal and human alike, drown out Brundib&aacute;r&rsquo;s organ playing and together sing a beautiful lullaby for Aninka and Pepiček&rsquo;s mother. Their performance earns them generous donations from passersby. Brundib&aacute;r steals their money, but the crowd of children chase him down and get it back. To conclude the opera, all the children sing a stirring song about friends banding together to gain victory over tyranny.</p>
				<p><strong>L&rsquo;Histoire du soldat (The Soldier&rsquo;s Tale)<br>Igor Stravinsky</strong></p>
				<p>Stravinsky shot to fame through his brilliant collaborations with the legendary Russian impresario, Sergei Diaghilev, and his dance company, Les Ballets russes: <em>The Firebird</em> (1910), <em>Petrushka</em> (1911) and <em>The Rite of Spring</em> (1913). The First World War temporarily put a halt to the partnership. The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, through which the imperial Russia where Stravinsky had grown up was dismantled, also made a profound impact upon him, in terms both spiritual and practical.</p>
				<p>Settling in Switzerland, he solidified and expanded the creative relationship with an author, Charles-Ferdinand Ramuz, that had begun in 1915. The tempestuous events of recent history had virtually wiped out Stravinsky&rsquo;s income from his music and his family estates. To make ends meet, he and Ramuz cast about for a joint project that would be inexpensive to produce and could be toured profitably throughout Switzerland. A new Stravinsky style, Neoclassicism, was born of those practicalities. <em>The Soldier&rsquo;s Tale</em>, the fascinating hybrid work that was so different from virtually everything he had composed previously, showed where he was headed stylistically (and where he would remain for the most part, until the 1950s).</p>
				<p>Stravinsky found a subject for them to work with in an anthology of Russian folk tales that he came across in the vast library of his father, Fyodor, the principal operatic bass of the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg. The story about a hapless Soldier who strikes a Faust-like, eventually tragic deal with the Devil, was set during the nineteenth-century reign of Tsar Nicholas I. In Ramuz and Stravinsky&rsquo;s version, they minimized any references to a specific time and place, in order to make their version of the allegorical fable more universal.</p>
				<p>They decided to present it as a kind of staged narration with music and a bit of choreography. Something &ldquo;to be read, played and danced,&rdquo; was how they described it. The performing company would include a handful of actors and dancers, accompanied by an ensemble of clarinet, bassoon, cornet, trombone, violin, double bass, and percussion. The cast has sometimes been narrowed to a single actor, taking the parts of narrator, Soldier and Devil. Such will be the case at this performance.</p>
				<p>Producing The Soldier&rsquo;s Tale proved more complicated than Stravinsky &amp; Co. had expected. Securing sufficiently skilled performers, as well as adequate rehearsal time and funding, were only the largest of many obstacles. Relations among the creators proved fractious at times, and everything about the project was in a constant state of flux. It was rescued financially by Werner Reinhart, a generous Swiss patron, who underwrote all expenses.</p>
				<p>The premiere took place in Lausanne on 28 September 1918, under Ernest Ansermet&rsquo;s baton. Stravinsky recalled that the portable stage was the size of two armchairs. The show won great success. A tour had been set up, but the Spanish influenza pandemic that had already devastated the war-weakened citizens of other countries swept into Switzerland, infected the contracted performers, and forced the tour&rsquo;s cancellation. In addition, the conclusion of World War One a short time later made the concept of touring theatre unnecessary.</p>
				<p>The following year, Stravinsky re-established his relationship with Diaghilev. There was no possibility of the Ballets russes staging <em>The Soldier&rsquo;s Tale</em>, as the temperamental impresario held little interest in a project into which he had had no input. It was only after several years and several unsuccessful productions that this unique, multi-discipline presentation found its way to popularity. Its greatest currency has been through the instrumental concert suite that Stravinsky drew from it in 1920, but it makes its full impact only when presented as it was conceived.</p>
				<p>Stravinsky&rsquo;s tart, witty and rhythmically intricate score displayed several influences: Russian folk song, gypsy fiddlers (reflecting the plot, the violin often takes the musical spotlight), klezmer groups, the popular music of Spain (The Royal March is an example of the pasodoble), and his recent exposure to jazz (the ensemble sounds like a Dixieland band at times). &ldquo;My knowledge of jazz was derived exclusively from copies of sheet music,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;and as I had never actually heard any of the music performed, I borrowed its rhythmic style not as played, but as written. I could imagine jazz sound, however, or so I liked to think. Jazz meant, in any case, a wholly new sound in my music, and <em>L&rsquo;Histoire du soldat</em> marks my final break with the Russian orchestral school in which I had been fostered.&rdquo; Among the music&rsquo;s other ingredients are parodies of military marches and popular music forms such as the tango, waltz and ragtime, and even two Lutheran chorales, including <em>Ein&rsquo; feste Burg ist under Gott</em>(A Mighty Fortress Is Our God).</p>

							<h4>Review:<br>Children&rsquo;s opera packs emotional wallop</h4>
							<p class="fineprintdark"><a href="http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/">Winnipeg Free Press</a>, by Holly Harris<br>Manitoba Chamber Orchestra; Earl Stafford, guest conductor<br>Pembina Trails Voices; Ruth Wiwchar, Director<br>Westminster United Church; Tue, Mar 12<br>Attendance: 764<br>Four stars out of five<br>&nbsp;</p>
							<p>Out of the inferno of the Holocaust have come many inspiring stories of courage, strength, survival, and defiance. <i>The Diary of Anne Frank</i>, published in 1947, still resonates as an extraordinary tale of resilience.</p>
							<p>The Manitoba Chamber Orchestra presented the seemingly innocent <i>Brundib&aacute;r</i> (The Bumblebee) Tuesday night, a poignant children&rsquo;s opera penned by Jewish Czech composer Hans Kr&aacute;sa that is a charming fairy tale and ethical manifesto dealing with the horrors of fascism.</p>
							<p>Winnipeg&rsquo;s premi&egrave;re children/youth vocal ensemble, Pembina Trails Voices, performed the 40-minute work with youthful energy, impeccably prepared by artistic director Ruth Wiwchar with efficient stage direction by Donna Fletcher. Notably, Wiwchar also led the orchestra situated in front of the stage area, stepping in for MCO&rsquo;s Anne Manson, who had become ill at the last minute.</p>
							<p>The story, based on Adolf Hoffmeister&rsquo;s libretto, is simple. First performed in its orchestral version in 1943 at the Theresienstadt concentration camp, it tells the tale of young Aninka and Pepicek, whose ailing mother needs milk to get well. Wicked organ grinder Brundib&aacute;r bullies them after they imitate his singing to raise money. Their fantastical friends, Dog, Cat, and Sparrow, joined by Ice Cream Seller, Baker and Milkman offer to help by singing a lullaby that earns them donations from passers-by. After Brundib&aacute;r steals their money, the children chase him down before reuniting to sing a victory song that celebrates the bonds of friendship in staring down adversity.</p>
							<p>This moving opera has been performed in the city before; last seen as a touring production by Saskatoon Children&rsquo;s Choir in June 2006. But whether one sees the opera for the first time, or many times, it&rsquo;s safe to say it will always pack an emotional wallop of sheer magnitude, literally giving voice to the ghetto&rsquo;s children who were murdered days after each of the original 55 performances, as well as serving as a living testament to the power of art. Even its unusual orchestration reflects harsh origins: scored for the 12 musicians available &mdash; and still alive &mdash; in the camp.</p>
							<p>Sung in English, all 78 children, and especially the 10 leads, performed with a sense of conviction their crystal-clear diction ensuring every word was heard. Their sweetly harmonized duets, trios, quartets and quintets interspersed throughout the show proved particularly heart-warming.</p>
							<p>The youthful cast is also to be commended for carrying on like true, seasoned pros when several sound issues inadvertently arose. Bravo to all, and especially to the tireless Wiwchar for bringing this important work to life, which elicited both laughter and tears in the audience of 764.</p>
							<p>The concert also included Stravinsky&rsquo;s <i>L&rsquo;Histoire Du Soldat</i> (The Soldier&rsquo;s Tale) featuring Winnipeg actor Arne MacPherson, who spun his Faustian tale as a master storyteller. Guest conductor Earl Stafford &mdash; again, filling in on scant notice &mdash; led the seven-piece ensemble through Stravinsky&rsquo;s rhythmically treacherous, episodic score with precision and fearless pluck.</p>
							<p>Kudos to MCO concertmaster Karl Stobbe for his solo passages packed with double and triple stops, especially during <i>Three Dances</i>, which morphs into a tango, waltz, and ragtime dance. Other highlights included <i>Royal March</i> with trumpeter Guy Few tossing off complex riffs like child&rsquo;s play, and MacPherson&rsquo;s animated, biting delivery during <i>The Devil&rsquo;s Song</i>.</p>
