		<h4>Exotic musical treats with soprano<br />Isabel Bayrakdarian</h4>
		<p>Touring, recording and concertizing is the work that keeps the MCO humming all year long. This manifold action often involves our interesting friend, soprano superstar Isabel Bayrakdarian, and her enchanting, mysterious musicality.</p>
		<p>Exotic is the word. &ldquo;There are some rarely-heard Armenian troubadour songs and some Greek songs by Ravel,&rdquo; says Anne Manson. &ldquo;Isabel is one of the very few singers who performs them in Greek and not in translation.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Watch for sneak previews of the material late in the summer at special concerts at The Forks and  at the Lyric Theatre. This material, combined with Kradjian&rsquo;s <em>Trobairitz Ysabella</em>, will form the basis of a new recording.</p>
		<p><strong>Serouj Kradjian</strong></p>
		<p>Serouj Kradjian is the musical mind behind the MCO&rsquo;s memorable concert that featured the Armenian music of Gomidas. The pianist and composer (and Isabel&rsquo;s husband) has established himself as a versatile artist whose readiness to break boundaries and explore different styles has made him an exciting voice on the international music scene.</p>

							<h4>Chamber Chatter</h4>
							<p class="fineprintdark"><em>Chamber Chatter</em> columnist <a href="http://www.donanderson.ca/">Don Anderson</a><br />also writes the MCO&rsquo;s program notes<br />&nbsp;</p>
							<p>In addition to a superb line-up of live performances, the MCO will celebrate its fortieth anniversary season with two outstanding new recordings.</p>
							<p>One of them follows through on last season’s all-Philip Glass concert, and on MCO Music Director and Conductor Anne Manson’s long-term relationship with the celebrated composer.</p>
							<p>&ldquo;Anne conducted Glass&rsquo;s chamber opera <em>Orph&eacute;e</em> in Portland, Oregon, a few years ago,&rdquo; said Vicki Young, the MCO&rsquo;s Managing Director. &ldquo;He was very pleased with the results. When he and his record company talked to her about making a record of the concert suite from his music for the film <em>The Hours</em>, she suggested that the MCO be the orchestra to do it, and to record his Third Symphony, too.&rdquo;</p>
							<p>The project came together quickly. A major player was the well-known, Winnipeg-born composer and impresario, Glenn Buhr. He’s the Artistic Director of the NUMUS new music concerts in Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario. &ldquo;Together we came up with a plan to give the music several live performances, as Anne prefers to do before a recording,&rdquo; Vicki said. &ldquo;The first was in Winnipeg, followed by Guelph, Kitchener-Waterloo, and finally the Glenn Gould Studio in Toronto. The performance at the Gould was recorded live, then we had a &lsquo;patch-up&rsquo; session the day after. We’ve heard the edited version and it sounds fantastic. It will be released by Glass’s own company, Orange Mountain Music, hopefully by January.&rdquo;</p>
							<p>The other MCO recording showcases the soloist at this concert, the superlative Armenian / Canadian soprano, Isabel Bayrakdarian, and the excellent composing and arranging gifts of her husband, Serouj Kradjian.</p>
							<p>&ldquo;We had booked Isabel to make her MCO debut in the 2009 / 10 season,&rdquo; Vicki said. &ldquo;But then in 2008 her agent phoned with an intriguing proposal. Isabel was scheduled to do a North American tour, accompanied by an Armenian orchestra. For some reason the orchestra couldn&rsquo;t make it, so her agent asked if the MCO could take over. Naturally we were thrilled to accept.</p>
							<p>&ldquo;I met with him at an orchestra conference in Denver and we worked out the details. Isabel was already set to perform a group of songs by an Armenian composer, Gomidas. We worked around them to put together a full concert program. The tour concerts were conducted by Anne Manson, who signed on as MCO Music Director and Conductor around the same time.&rdquo;</p>
							<p>The concerts took place in San Francisco, Vancouver, Toronto, Boston, and in Carnegie Hall, New York, and were very successful. Anne, Isabel, and Serouj began getting to know each other during that tour, and started to plan another joint project.</p>
							<p>&ldquo;Anne had read a book about the music of Spain,&rdquo; Vicki said, &ldquo;and the three of them came up with the idea of a new piece, composed by Serouj, that would centre on the female troubadours of medieval Spain. Serouj called it <em>Trobairitz Ysabella</em> (Troubadour Isabel). It was co-commissioned by the MCO and the CBC, and the MCO performed it in 2010.&rdquo;</p>
							<p>The MCO performed it again last month, in outdoor concerts at the Lyric Theatre in Assiniboine Park, and at The Forks, then recorded it in the Cathedral Church of St. John. For the CD, it will be paired with the Ravel and Sayat-Nova songs that Serouj arranged for Isabel, and which will she will perform at tonight&rsquo;s concert. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t finalized a distribution agreement,&rdquo; Vicki said, &ldquo;but the recording should be available before long. It will be available in CD and electronic formats, on an international basis. We may do a &lsquo;launch tour&rsquo; when it&rsquo;s ready.&rdquo; Watch this space for further announcements!</p>

						<h4>Review:<br />Singer Bayrakdarian illustrates<br /> how music transcends language</h4>
						<p class="fineprintdark"><a href="http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/">Winnipeg Free Press</a>, by Gwenda Nemerofsky<br />Manitoba Chamber Orchestra; Isabel Bayrakdarian, soprano<br />Westminster United Church; Wed, Sep 12<br />Attendance: 604<br />Four stars out of five<br />&nbsp;</p>
						<p>If you ever doubted that music could transcend language, Wednesday night&rsquo;s Manitoba Chamber Orchestra (MCO) concert would have changed your mind.</p>
						<p>Guest artist, spectacular Armenian-Canadian soprano Isabel Bayrakdarian sang in Greek and Armenian. Audience members were provided lyric sheets with translations, but who wanted to read fussy bits of paper when Bayrakdarian was onstage? This musical treasure told us everything we needed to know with her limpid voice, impassioned facial expressions and graceful gestures. No words necessary.</p>
						<p>The concert was introduced by the always debonair CBC Radio 2 personality, Bill Richardson. Conductor Anne Manson was at the helm for this 40th anniversary season opener.</p>
						<p><strong>Gourmet candy</strong></p>
						<p>Bayrakdarian began with <em>Five Greek Songs</em> by Maurice Ravel, arranged by her husband Serouj Kradjian. It was evident from the singer&rsquo;s appearance that the couple is expecting an addition to their family soon, but this did not affect her gorgeous voice. The song cycle resembled a box of gourmet candy, each piece more deliciously tempting than the last.</p>
						<p><em>Song of the Bride</em> was immediately lilting, full of colour and power. <em>Yonder, Near the Church</em> had a somewhat melancholy tenor, rendered with long seamless phrases that were satisfyingly assertive. Bayrakdarian is so communicative, possessing a unique style that makes you feel that she is singing right to you. The soulful <em>Song of the Lentisk Gatherers</em> displayed her purity of tone, full of emotion and subtle inflection. And <em>All Merry!</em> was a dance in song form, bursting with playfulness.</p>
						<p>The addition of the separate Ravel song, <em>Tripatos</em> was joyous fun, Bayrakdarian almost laughing as she sang.</p>
						<p>She also performed 18th-century Armenian composer Sayat-Nova&rsquo;s <em>Four Songs</em>, arranged by Kradjian. One couldn&rsquo;t help but be struck by the modern tunefulness of the poignant first song <em>Kani Voor Janim</em>, Bayrakdarian&rsquo;s voice carrying effortlessly through the hall. Versatile concertmaster Karl Stobbe matched her emotion in his solo violin passages in <em>Blbooli Hit</em>, which was steeped in sorrow, his sensitive playing well-controlled. We felt we had travelled back in time to an earlier Armenia. The spirited Kamancha was an ode to the Armenian bowed instrument. Bayrakdarian&rsquo;s weighty voice crafted this beautifully, deftly shaping phrase endings, imbuing it with personality. You really couldn&rsquo;t ask for more.</p>
						<p>The concert ended with Manson and the MCO whisking us off to Dvo&#345;&aacute;k's Czech countryside in a rousing performance of his elegantly substantial <em>Serenade for Strings</em>.</p>
						<p>This is a work that shows the composer's love of the instruments &mdash; and he gives everyone a chance to shine. Overall, the musicians made the most of the opportunity, sweeping us up in the introductory melody with smooth bowing and effective nuance. The tempo di valse was wonderfully textured, only marred by a few stray violins letting their colleagues down with squeals and untidy notes. But the scherzo brimmed with life, violins scampering brightly and the finale was suitably upright and urgent. A nice start to the season.</p>
