		<h4><div>Cellist Asier Polo<br>&ldquo;had audience at first note&rdquo;</div></h4>
		<p>When Anne Manson first heard cellist Asier Polo performing in Galicia, Spain, making him part of an MCO season became a priority. The audience&rsquo;s response to our 2012 concert was over the top, and now popular demand brings him back!</p>
		<p>In her <i>Winnipeg Free Press</i> review of that first concert, Holly Harris wrote about his &ldquo;... fierce artistry and utter surrender to music-making.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Get ready! The passion that made that concert so memorable will be in abundance as Polo will perform not one, but two wonderfully different cello concertos this time around!</p>
		<p><b>1689 Francesco Ruggieri cello</b></p>
		<p>Asier Polo will work his wonders on a cello just about as old as, or even older than, the music he will be playing! Some things certainly do seem to last ...</p>
		<p>Although Francesco Ruggieri made violins and violas, his importance stems from his development of a smaller version of the cello that is now the standard. All instruments created by Ruggieri are highly desirable owing to their superior construction and tone (Wikipedia).</p>

				<p><b>Asier Polo</b></p>
				<p>Asier Polo is fast becoming one of the leading cellists of his generation, renowned both in his native Spain and in other European countries. Said Anne Manson, &ldquo;Asier is the best cellist in Spain, and of truly international calibre. I worked with him four years ago in Spain. He is extraordinary and I thought we have got to get him to the MCO!&rdquo; And who could forget Asier&rsquo;s 2012 performance of Boccherini&rsquo;s second cello concerto with the MCO that resulted from her determination?</p>
				<p>Polo has toured South America with the National Orchestra of Spain (Fr&uuml;hbeck de Burgos conducting) and performed concerts with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, Orchestra Sinfonica Nazionale della RAI, the Bergen Philharmonic, Dresdner&rsquo;s Philharmonie, Opera Orchestra of Nice, the National Orchestra of Bordeaux, Prague&rsquo;s Chamber Orchestra, Basle&rsquo;s Philharmonic and the Monterrey Symphony Orchestra (California). He has also performed with most of the major Spanish orchestras and has been invited to play in many European festivals. </p>
				<p>The critically acclaimed cellist shared the stage with Alfredo Kraus during the last years of the famous tenor&rsquo;s career, performing in concert halls such as Maggio Fiorentino (Florence) and Covent Garden (London), as well as with artists like Josep Maria Colom, Gereard Causs&eacute; and the Janacek Quartet. He recently appeared at the Carnegie Weill Recital Hall in New York.</p>
				<p>Current and future engagements include concerts with Dresdner Philharmonie, Orchestra Sinfonica Nazionale della RAI (Turin), Monterey Symphony Orchestra (California) Huntsville Symphony Orchestra (US), Orchestre de Paris, Orquesta Sinf&oacute;nica Nacional de M&eacute;jico, Orquesta Sinf&oacute;nica de Mineria (M&eacute;jico), Orquesta de Teatro Lirico de Gagliari, Orquesta Sinf&ocirc;nica do Estado de S&acirc;o Paulo, Orquesta Nacional de Espa&ntilde;a, symphonic orchestras of Sevilla, Bilbao, Principado de Asturias, Murcia, Baleares, Orquesta Filarm&oacute;nica de Gran Canaria, Orquesta Filarm&oacute;nica de M&aacute;laga among others.</p>
				<p>Asier Polo has recorded for Claves, RTVE, Marco Polo and Naxos. Spanish composers G. Ercoreca, Luis de Pablo and Ant&oacute;n García Abril have all dedicated works to this outstanding musician. He teaches at the Centro Superior de M&uacute;sica del País Vasco. He plays a Francesco Rugieri instrument (Cremona 1689).</p>
				<p><b>Dorothy Chang</b></p>
				<p>Described as &ldquo;evocative and kaleidoscopic&rdquo; (<i>Seattle Times</i>), the music of Dorothy Chang is characterized by an emphasis on dramatic intensity and expressive lyricism, with a more recent interest in interdisciplinary works involving video, imagery and movement.  </p>
				<p>Her music has been performed by orchestras including the Albany (NY) Symphony, Aspen Concert Orchestra, Chicago Civic Orchestra, Indianapolis Symphony, Queens Symphony, Seattle Symphony, Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, Vancouver Island and Vancouver Symphony, as well as by chamber ensembles including eighth blackbird, the Smith Quartet (UK), the Chicago Saxophone Quartet, Collage New Music (Boston), North/South Consonance (New York), Music from China, and Soundstreams (Toronto). It has been featured in concerts and festivals across North America and abroad, most recently at the PAN Music Festival (Seoul), Lontano Festival (UK), and World Music Days in Hong Kong.</p>
				<p>Awards and honours that Dorothy has received include a Charles Ives Scholarship from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, awards from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, the International Alliance for Women in Music, Mu Phi Epsilon, the National Society of Arts and Letters, Meet the Composer and the Jacob Druckman Orchestra Prize from the Aspen Music Festival. She has received commissions from the Canada Council of the Arts, the British Columbia Arts Council, the Barlow Endowment, Chamber Music America, and the Mary Flagler Cary Charitable Trust.  For the 2003/04 and 2005 to 2008 seasons, Dorothy held a Music Alive composer residency with the Albany Symphony Orchestra.</p>
				<p>In 2008, she was awarded the inaugural commission from the Women&rsquo;s Philharmonic Commissioning Project of Meet the Composer, for a new orchestral work, <i>Strange Air</i>, which was premiered at the Cabrillo Festival  of Contemporary Music by conductor Marin Alsop and the festival orchestra.</p>
				<p>Born in Winfield, Illinois, Dorothy began her music studies on piano at age six, and began composing at the age of fourteen. She received degrees in composition from the University of Michigan (B.M., M.M.) and the Indiana University School of Music (D.M). She has served on the music faculty at Indiana State University, and is currently Associate Professor of Music at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.</p>
