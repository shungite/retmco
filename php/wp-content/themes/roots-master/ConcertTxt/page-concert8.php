		<p>When this pair of incredible vocalists sang with the MCO in 2004, Gwenda Nemerofsky of the Winnipeg Free Press wrote, &ldquo;One couldn’t help but be struck by the remarkable blending of voices. They are perfectly matched, LeBlanc&rsquo;s voice ringing throughout the church more sonorously than any bell, Taylor producing notes as thick and sweet as honey. Nothing could have improved on this performance.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Well, we thought of one thing: make the duo part of our 40th Anniversary Season!
		<p>Anne Manson says, &ldquo;this is Daniel’s program of baroque and classical repertoire. They are incredibly refined experts in this music and we think our audience will really enjoy a chance to hear these two terrific Canadian singers again.&rdquo;</p>

				<p><strong>Overture, and Scherzano<br />sul tuo volto (Charming graces<br />play upon your face), from &lsquo;Rinaldo&rsquo;<br />George Frideric Handel</strong></p>
				<p>Handel became a true cosmopolitan, an enormously skilled composer who wove together the various musical threads of the day into a rich and varied personal style. He began absorbing these influences early in his career. He spent that period first in Germany (his homeland) and then in Italy. During the second decade of the eighteenth century, he settled in England, there to remain and there to win his greatest fame and influence.</p>
				<p>One of his reasons for locating there was the popularity of a type of music with which he was already quite familiar, and through which he had won great success: Italian‑style opera. Over the next 30 years, he devoted the major portion of his creative energies to supplying English audiences with that type of piece. London&rsquo;s music lovers received his operas enthusiastically, with <em>Giulio Cesare</em>, <em>Ariodante</em> and <em>Serse</em> proving especially popular.</p>
				<p>By the time Handel paid his first visit to England in 1710, two operas had already made his name familiar to London audiences. Aaron Hill, manager of the Queen&rsquo;s Theatre in the Haymarket district, quickly commissioned a new work from him. Handel composed Rinaldo in just two weeks, drawing, as was common practice of the day, upon his earlier works for much of the music. The premiere on February 24, 1711 launched his highly successful career as a composer of operas for England. It caused a sensation, running for 15 nights and receiving frequent revivals over the following decades. It became his most popular opera with his London audiences, receiving 53 performances during his lifetime.</p>
				<p>Hill&rsquo;s libretto, rendered into Italian by Giacomo Rossi, drew upon two popular sixteenth-century epic poems, Torquato Tasso&rsquo;s <em>Jerusalem Liberated</em>, and Ludovico Ariosto&rsquo;s <em>Orlando furioso</em>. It tells a tale of love, sorcery and heroism, set during the first crusade. Scherzano sul tuo volto is a duet between Rinaldo, a celebrated Christian hero, and Almirena, his betrothed, the daughter of Goffredo, captain of the Christian armies.</p>
				<p><strong>Se spiego i sensi miei<br />(If I explain my senses), from &lsquo;Flaminio&rsquo;<br />Giovanni Battista Pergolesi</strong></p>
				<p>For a composer who lived just 26 years, Pergolesi made an astonishing impact on the musical life of Europe. After early studies in his native town, Iesi in Italy, he continued his education in Naples. He received his first operatic commission shortly after he graduated in 1731. He regularly composed for the theatre and for church services, all the while increasing his success and raising the calibre of his positions in the service of various noble families. His always fragile health deteriorated dramatically during the summer of 1735, and he died from tuberculosis the following year.</p>
				<p>The popularity he achieved during his lifetime was exceeded by his enormous posthumous fame. Numerous compositions were mis-attributed to him, some intentionally to cash in on his name. His music is prized above all for its spontaneity, freshness, melodic beauty and expressive text setting. These qualities represent notable advances on the rigid, highly stylized music of the earlier, high baroque period.</p>
				<p>The comic opera <em>Flaminio</em> premiered in Naples in 1735. The farcical plot involves romantic complications, disguises, misunderstandings and such. <em>Se spiego i sensi miei</em> is a duet sung by a young widow, Giustina, and Flaminio, secretary to Polidoro, a wealthy Neapolitan.</p>
				<p><strong>Gelosia, tu già rendi l&rsquo;alma mia<br />(Jealousy, you have to make my soul)<br />from 'Ottone in villa'Antonio Vivaldi</strong></p>
				<p>Vivaldi is best known as a composer of purely instrumental music, his 500-plus concertos in particular. In his day he was also a highly successful composer of operas. He created the first one in 1713, and nearly 50 more over the remaining 28 years of his life.</p>
				<p><em>Ottone in villa</em> (Otho in His Villa) is Vivaldi&rsquo;s earliest surviving opera. It premiered in Vicenza in 1713. Domenico Lalli&rsquo;s libretto is a pastoral drama set in ancient Rome, revolving around the Roman Emperor, Otho, and the romantic complications in his life. This fiery aria is sung by Caio, a young Roman with whom Otho has been flirting.</p>
				<p><strong>Barbaro traditor (Barbaric traitor)<br />from &lsquo;Il Tamerlano&rsquo; (Bajazet)<br />Antonio Vivaldi</strong></p>
				<p>Vivaldi&rsquo;s opera <em>Il Tamerlano</em> (Bajazet) premiered in Verona during the 1735 carnival season. It is a pasticcio, an amalgamation of pre-existing music that Vivaldi put together primarily from the operas of Johann Adolf Hasse, Geminiano Giacomelli, Nicola Porpora and Riccardo Broschi. He also re-used certain arias from his own operas, and composed new ones, as well. Agostino Piovene adapted the libretto from the French playwright Jacques Pradon&rsquo;s tragedy <em>Tamerlan</em>, ou <em>La mort de Bajazet</em> (Tamerlano, or the Death of Bajazet). Bajazet, the leader of the Ottoman empire, has been defeated in battle and captured by Tamerlano, the Turkish-Mongol conqueror. He nobly commits suicide in order to help his daughter marry her true love, a Greek prince, rather than Tamerlano. Tamerlano sings the vigorous aria <em>Barbaro traditor</em> in Act Two.</p>
				<p><strong>Se mai più sarò geloso (If ever again<br />I will be jealous), from &lsquo;Cleofide&rsquo;<br />Johann Adolf Hasse</strong></p>
				<p>Although German composer Hasse is largely forgotten, he enjoyed the status of the most celebrated composer of dramatic operas (some 70 in all) in both the German and Italian-speaking countries for several decades. He also found great success throughout Europe in oratorio, sacred vocal music, and instrumental composition.</p>
				<p>The opera Cleofide premiered in Dresden, Germany, in 1731. Johann Sebastian Bach was in the audience. Pietro Metastasio&rsquo;s libretto concerns Alexander the Great&rsquo;s invasion of India and his relationships with members of that country&rsquo;s nobility, especially the regal queen, Cleophis (Cleofide). This sparkling duet is sung by Cleofide and her co-ruler, Poro.</p>
				<p><strong>Vieni, appaga il tuo consorte<br />(Come, satisfy your wife)<br />and Che farò senza Euridice<br />(What will I do without Euridice)<br />from &lsquo;Orfeo ed Euridice&rsquo;<br />Christoph Willibald von Gluck</strong></p>
				<p>Gluck&rsquo;s early operas conformed strictly to the standards of the day: plots were far removed from reality and genuine emotions, and displaying the skills of virtuoso singers drew far more attention than the quality of either music or text. Over time, Gluck and the poets who wrote the librettos for his operas made conscious efforts to change all this. As with any innovator, Gluck met with great hostility in conservative circles, but he eventually won through to fame and honour. Later composers who esteemed him highly (and whose music would hardly have been possible without him) include Mozart, Berlioz and Wagner.</p>
				<p>Gluck is known to modern-day audiences primarily through Orpheus and Euridice, the earliest opera to retain a place in the standard international repertoire. The original, Italian-language version (Orfeo ed Euridice) debuted in Vienna in 1762. A revised edition with French text (Orphée et Eurydice) was first heard in Paris in 1774.</p>
				<p>The plot retells the Greek myth of the minstrel Orpheus, who travels to the underworld in hopes of bringing his dead wife, Euridice, back with him. The sincerity of his enduring love and the beautiful music he plays on his lyre win over the rulers of the underworld. In breaking his vow not to look at Euridice during his return journey to earth, he risks losing her forever, until the god of love intercedes on their behalf.</p>
				<p>Orpheus and Euridice sing the highly emotional duet, Vieni, appaga il tuo consorte, during their journey from the underworld back to earth. Since he has not explained that he may not look at her as they travel, she reproaches him for no longer loving her. After he has gazed upon her, and she has died once again, he sings the heartbroken lament, Che farò senza Euridice.</p>
				<p><strong>Ach, ich fühl&rsquo;s, es ist verschwunden<br />(Ah, I feel it, it has vanished), from<br />&lsquo;Die Zauberflöte&rsquo; (The Magic Flute)<br />Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</strong></p>
				<p>Mozart and the colourful impresario/singer/actor Emanuel Schikaneder (1751-1812) met in 1780, when Schikaneder arrived in Salzburg, Mozart&rsquo;s home town, together with his rowdy troupe of musical theatre performers. He quickly became friends with the entire Mozart family. Mozart relocated to Vienna the following year. In 1789, he and Schikaneder renewed what had become a lagging friendship, when Schikaneder &amp; Co. set up shop at the barn-sized Theatre auf der Wieden in a Viennese suburb.</p>
				<p>It was just a matter of time before he would ask Mozart to collaborate with him. What spurred him on was the prospect of a hot-ticket show that would rescue the company from near bankruptcy. Mozart, himself facing serious monetary challenges, accepted the offer eagerly. He composed the singspiel (play with music), The Magic Flute, between June and September 1791. The premiere took place on September 30, two months before his death.</p>
				<p>The hero is Prince Tamino, who must bravely undergo rituals of purification in order to achieve two goals: priesthood in the Temple of Wisdom, and the hand of his sweetheart, Pamina. Pamina sings the sublimely melancholy aria, Ach, ich fühl&rsquo;s, es ist verschwunden in Act Two, not understanding that Tamino is ignoring her only because he has taken a vow of silence as part of his initiation into the Temple.</p>
				<p><strong>Qual candido fiore<br />(What white flower), from &lsquo;Farnace&rsquo;<br />Antonio Vivaldi</strong></p>
				<p>Vivaldi&rsquo;s opera Farnace premiered at the San Angelo theatre in Venice in 1727. It won such great success that it was produced in Prague three years later. After that it slipped into obscurity until it was revived successfully during the final quarter of the twentieth century. Antonio Maria Lucchini&rsquo;s libretto concerns Farnace, King of Pontus (nowadays the north-eastern region of Turkey), and his complicated relations with his family and with the Romans who have conquered his land. This attractive aria is sung by Berenice, his mother-in-law.</p>
				<p><strong>Ombra mai fu (A shade<br />there never was), from &lsquo;Serse&rsquo;<br />George Frideric Handel</strong></p>
				<p>Handel&rsquo;s opera <em>Serse</em> (also known as <em>Xerxes</em>) premiered in London in 1738. The title character was the King of Persia in the fifth century B.C. He sings this beloved aria, one of Handel&rsquo;s most familiar creations, at the very beginning of the opera. Its sublime beauty might lead you to think that he is addressing some profound religious or philosophical idea, when in fact he is offering thanks to a plane tree for the shade it is providing on a hot day.</p>
				<p><strong>Se il cor ti perde (If my heart<br />should lose you), from &lsquo;Tolomeo&rsquo;<br />George Frideric Handel</strong></p>
				<p>This Handel opera was first produced in London in 1728. The plot is based on historical figures in the ruling dynasty of Egypt during the second century B.C. In Nicola Haym&rsquo;s libretto, the title character, Ptolemy IX, is joint ruler of the country with his mother, Cleopatra. She joins forces with his younger brother to banish him, but he regains his throne by the end of the opera. This tender love duet is sung by Ptolemy and his wife, Seleuce.</p>
