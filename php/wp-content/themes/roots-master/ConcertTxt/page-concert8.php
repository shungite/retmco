		<h4><div>Cellist Asier Polo<br>&ldquo;had audience at first note&rdquo;</div></h4>
		<p>When Anne Manson first heard cellist Asier Polo performing in Galicia, Spain, making him part of an MCO season became a priority. The audience&rsquo;s response to our 2012 concert was over the top, and now popular demand brings him back!</p>
		<p>In her <i>Winnipeg Free Press</i> review of that first concert, Holly Harris wrote about his &ldquo;... fierce artistry and utter surrender to music-making.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Get ready! The passion that made that concert so memorable will be in abundance as Polo will perform not one, but two wonderfully different cello concertos this time around!</p>
		<p><b>1689 Francesco Ruggieri cello</b></p>
		<p>Asier Polo will work his wonders on a cello just about as old as, or even older than, the music he will be playing! Some things certainly do seem to last ...</p>
		<p>Although Francesco Ruggieri made violins and violas, his importance stems from his development of a smaller version of the cello that is now the standard. All instruments created by Ruggieri are highly desirable owing to their superior construction and tone (Wikipedia).</p>

				<p><b>Asier Polo</b></p>
				<p>Asier Polo is fast becoming one of the leading cellists of his generation, renowned both in his native Spain and in other European countries. Said Anne Manson, &ldquo;Asier is the best cellist in Spain, and of truly international calibre. I worked with him four years ago in Spain. He is extraordinary and I thought we have got to get him to the MCO!&rdquo; And who could forget Asier&rsquo;s 2012 performance of Boccherini&rsquo;s second cello concerto with the MCO that resulted from her determination?</p>
				<p>Polo has toured South America with the National Orchestra of Spain (Fr&uuml;hbeck de Burgos conducting) and performed concerts with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, Orchestra Sinfonica Nazionale della RAI, the Bergen Philharmonic, Dresdner&rsquo;s Philharmonie, Opera Orchestra of Nice, the National Orchestra of Bordeaux, Prague&rsquo;s Chamber Orchestra, Basle&rsquo;s Philharmonic and the Monterrey Symphony Orchestra (California). He has also performed with most of the major Spanish orchestras and has been invited to play in many European festivals. </p>
				<p>The critically acclaimed cellist shared the stage with Alfredo Kraus during the last years of the famous tenor&rsquo;s career, performing in concert halls such as Maggio Fiorentino (Florence) and Covent Garden (London), as well as with artists like Josep Maria Colom, Gereard Causs&eacute; and the Janacek Quartet. He recently appeared at the Carnegie Weill Recital Hall in New York.</p>
				<p>Current and future engagements include concerts with Dresdner Philharmonie, Orchestra Sinfonica Nazionale della RAI (Turin), Monterey Symphony Orchestra (California) Huntsville Symphony Orchestra (US), Orchestre de Paris, Orquesta Sinf&oacute;nica Nacional de M&eacute;jico, Orquesta Sinf&oacute;nica de Mineria (M&eacute;jico), Orquesta de Teatro Lirico de Gagliari, Orquesta Sinf&ocirc;nica do Estado de S&acirc;o Paulo, Orquesta Nacional de Espa&ntilde;a, symphonic orchestras of Sevilla, Bilbao, Principado de Asturias, Murcia, Baleares, Orquesta Filarm&oacute;nica de Gran Canaria, Orquesta Filarm&oacute;nica de M&aacute;laga among others.</p>
				<p>Asier Polo has recorded for Claves, RTVE, Marco Polo and Naxos. Spanish composers G. Ercoreca, Luis de Pablo and Ant&oacute;n García Abril have all dedicated works to this outstanding musician. He teaches at the Centro Superior de M&uacute;sica del País Vasco. He plays a Francesco Rugieri instrument (Cremona 1689).</p>
				<p><b>Dorothy Chang</b></p>
				<p>Described as &ldquo;evocative and kaleidoscopic&rdquo; (<i>Seattle Times</i>), the music of Dorothy Chang is characterized by an emphasis on dramatic intensity and expressive lyricism, with a more recent interest in interdisciplinary works involving video, imagery and movement.  </p>
				<p>Her music has been performed by orchestras including the Albany (NY) Symphony, Aspen Concert Orchestra, Chicago Civic Orchestra, Indianapolis Symphony, Queens Symphony, Seattle Symphony, Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, Vancouver Island and Vancouver Symphony, as well as by chamber ensembles including eighth blackbird, the Smith Quartet (UK), the Chicago Saxophone Quartet, Collage New Music (Boston), North/South Consonance (New York), Music from China, and Soundstreams (Toronto). It has been featured in concerts and festivals across North America and abroad, most recently at the PAN Music Festival (Seoul), Lontano Festival (UK), and World Music Days in Hong Kong.</p>
				<p>Awards and honours that Dorothy has received include a Charles Ives Scholarship from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, awards from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, the International Alliance for Women in Music, Mu Phi Epsilon, the National Society of Arts and Letters, Meet the Composer and the Jacob Druckman Orchestra Prize from the Aspen Music Festival. She has received commissions from the Canada Council of the Arts, the British Columbia Arts Council, the Barlow Endowment, Chamber Music America, and the Mary Flagler Cary Charitable Trust.  For the 2003/04 and 2005 to 2008 seasons, Dorothy held a Music Alive composer residency with the Albany Symphony Orchestra.</p>
				<p>In 2008, she was awarded the inaugural commission from the Women&rsquo;s Philharmonic Commissioning Project of Meet the Composer, for a new orchestral work, <i>Strange Air</i>, which was premiered at the Cabrillo Festival  of Contemporary Music by conductor Marin Alsop and the festival orchestra.</p>
				<p>Born in Winfield, Illinois, Dorothy began her music studies on piano at age six, and began composing at the age of fourteen. She received degrees in composition from the University of Michigan (B.M., M.M.) and the Indiana University School of Music (D.M). She has served on the music faculty at Indiana State University, and is currently Associate Professor of Music at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.</p>

				<p><b>Cello Concerto in C Minor, RV 401<br>Antonio Vivaldi</b></p>
				<p>Vivaldi was not only one of the most important early figures in the history of the concerto, but also one of the foremost violin soloists of his day. He taught music, as well, primarily at the Conservatorio dell&rsquo; Ospedale della Piet&agrave;, a charitable home for orphan girls in his home city, Venice.</p>
				<p>The composition of his nearly 30 cello concertos spanned an approximately equal number of years. They are the earliest pieces of their kind, the only semi-equivalents being concertos involving several solo instruments, the cello among them, by composers such as Tommaso Albinoni. With his cello concertos, Vivaldi created a wealth of superb music for which eternally repertoire-starved cello soloists have been most grateful ever since.</p>
				<p>No evidence exists to show that he played the cello himself, but the roster of young women who studied and played it at the Piet&agrave; is extensive and includes such charming names as Paolina and Veneranda. The high regard in which the cello was held there can be measured by the fact that a celebrated soloist, Antonio Vandini, briefly occupied the position of primary teacher of string instruments.</p>
				<p>This Concerto in C Minor is a somber, intensely expressive creation in which Vivaldi demonstrates the cello&rsquo;s lyrical side to full effect. The grieving nature of the slow second movement makes a particularly eloquent effect, one which the vigorous but still dark-toned finale makes little attempt to mollify.</p>
				<p><b>Symphony No. 87 in A Major<br>Joseph Haydn</b></p>
				<p>During Haydn&rsquo;s first 30 years as director of music to the aristocratic Esterházy family (1761-1790), he remained a virtual prisoner (and most decidedly a servant rather than a resident artist) on their lavish estates, in and around Vienna. Although his initial arrangement with them forbade his composing for others patrons or organizations, his music became known anyway, from quite early on. It did so largely through pirated copies (often of poor quality). So lofty did his continent-wide reputation become that numerous inferior works by other composers were published under his name. </p>
				<p>The new contract that he entered into in 1779 finally gave him permission to accept commissions from outside sources. Perhaps his employer, Prince Nicholas, came to realize that having so renowned an artist in his retinue could only enhance his own reputation. Taken together, all these factors made Haydn the most revered and popular composer in Europe. </p>
				<p>One city where he became exceptionally popular was Paris, where his symphonies had been performed as early as the 1760s. The Concert de la Loge Olympique was the city&rsquo;s most prestigious orchestra. It was also one of the largest in Europe, sporting 40 violins, 10 double basses and matching ranks of virtuoso wind players (totaling more members than many full modern orchestras!).</p>
				<p>In 1785, the orchestra commissioned six new symphonies from Haydn. Reflecting his reputation, the officers of the Loge offered him five times their usual fee: 25 louis d&rsquo;or each, plus a further five for the publishing rights (this translates to more than $60 thousand per symphony in modern currency). He composed the pieces, which have become known as symphonies 83, 85 and 87 in 1785; nos. 82, 84 and 86 followed over the next year. Premiered to great acclaim during the Loge&rsquo;s 1787 concert season, under the direction of the Chevalier de Saint-George, they have been known ever since as his &lsquo;Paris&rsquo; symphonies. </p>
				<p>The opportunity to have new works performed in a major centre by a first-rank orchestra inspired Haydn to compose his finest symphonies to date. They earned such acclaim that they were quickly programmed by a rival Paris group, the Concert Spirituel. The Italian musician Luigi Cherubini, destined to become one of the greatest operatic composers of the early nineteenth century, performed as a violinist in the Loge Olympique premieres of the &lsquo;Paris&rsquo; symphonies. He commented that the orchestra adored the new works and performed them with enormous enthusiasm. They display a consistently high quality, but one quite unfair reason why three of them have proven more popular than others is their acquisition of nicknames: &lsquo;The Bear&rsquo; (No. 82), &lsquo;The Hen&rsquo; (No. 83), and &lsquo;The Queen of France&rsquo; (No. 85). </p>
				<p>In No. 87, Haydn dispensed with an introduction in slow tempo, plunging listeners instantly into a world of bustling energy (bold first theme) and winsome good humour (quiet, witty second theme). His use of the bright key of A Major &ldquo;is so ingratiating that we feel almost transported to south of the Alps,&rdquo; to quote the noted Haydn scholar, HC Robbins Landon. At one point the music seems almost to end &mdash; but Haydn rapidly disabuses the listener of that notion.</p>
				<p>The following movement is genuinely slow, in contrast to Haydn&rsquo;s regular use of moderate-tempo movements in this position. It sports a primary theme that is hymn-like in nature. Haydn here used the woodwind instruments with immense skill. Landon cites the climax of this movement for its &ldquo;autumnal beauty&rdquo; and for evoking so poignantly the &ldquo;slanted rays of the sun.&rdquo; A minuet is next, its strongly accented rhythm evoking a rustic celebration. The solo oboe takes the spotlight in the central trio section. The vivacious finale employs a single theme, which Haydn ingeniously developed to produce several simultaneous musical lines.</p>
				<p><b>Virtuosities<br>Dorothy Chang</b></p>
				<p><i>The composer has provided the following note, which she wrote for this composition&rsquo;s world premiere during the MCO&rsquo;s 12/13 season.</i></p>
				<p>In hon­our of the fortieth anniversary sea­son of the Man­itoba Cham­ber Orches­tra, I was inspired to write a work that cel­eb­rates music his­tory and tra­di­tion while also embra­cing the new and innov­at­ive &mdash; some­thing that the MCO has so suc­cess­fully accom­plished through­out its 40 years. <i>Vir­tu­os­it­ies</i> seeks to draw con­nec­tions between the music of the past and present, either through points of inter­sec­tion or through sharply con­trast­ing juxtaposition.</p>
				<p>In the first move­ment, <i>To dream, per­chance to fly</i>, a lightning-fast tempo and con­tinu­ous swirls of rising fig­ures are meant to cre­ate a breath­less, whirlwind energy, ref­er­en­cing ele­ments of Baroque vir­tu­os­ity within a con­tem­por­ary con­text. The intim­ate and lyr­ical second move­ment, <i>Souvenir</i>, features the beau­ti­ful sim­pli­city of a straight­for­ward melody-and-background tex­ture, enriched with an expan­ded sound palette of dis­tinct col­ours and timbres. In the final move­ment, <i>Mech­an­ica</i>, an ener­getic walk­ing bass serves a con­stant driv­ing pulse over which a hodge­podge of vari­ous short quotes and other musical ref­er­ences are spliced, layered and woven together.</p>
				<p><b>Variations on a Rococo Theme, Op. 33<br>Pyotr Il&rsquo;yich Tchaikovsky</b></p>
				<p>Tchaikovsky adored the courtly music of the eighteenth century, in particular the elegant rococo style of Mozart. He paid homage with this charming set of variations, which he composed in 1876. The soloist for whom he intended it, Wilhelm Fitzenhagen, took it upon himself to &ldquo;improve&rdquo; the variations. He shuffled the order, eliminated completely the last (and most difficult) of them, and replaced it with the original variation No. 4. Tchaikovsky held ambivalent feelings towards Fitzenhagen&rsquo;s revisions. Nevertheless, apparently weary of the affair and having received news that Fitzenhagen was dying, one of his pupils reported that he cried out, &lsquo;The devil take it! Let it stand as it is!&rdquo; At this evening&rsquo;s concert you will hear a version which follows the sequence of variations as established by Fitzenhagen, but in which the orchestral accompaniment has been transcribed for strings alone by Ward Veenstra.</p>
				<p>The brief introduction establishes both the gentle, refined mood and the transparency of the chamber orchestra scoring. The soloist introduces the relaxed and winsome theme — and rarely gets a breather after doing so. The variations rarely stray far from it, transmuting it into, among other things, a nostalgic waltz (variation 3) and a sorrowful lament (variation 7).</p>
