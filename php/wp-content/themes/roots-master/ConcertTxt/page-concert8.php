				<p><b>Sonata in D Major, HWV 371<br>George Frideric Handel</b></p>

				<p>Handel divided his early years between Germany and Italy. During the second decade of the eighteenth century, he settled in England, there to remain for the rest of his life. He began his English years by concentrating on that era&rsquo;s most popular genre of music: Italian style opera. The public&rsquo;s taste changed, however, embracing the less ornate and more easily understood English language oratorio. Handel, to his distress, twigged to this trend only slowly. Once he did see the light, he had little trouble regaining pre-eminence with his listeners.</p>

				<p>He regularly composed instrumental works in addition to vocal ones. They included a variety of sonatas for one or two melody instruments and basso continuo, plus numerous solo concertos and two superb sets of concerti grossi. Many of these pieces include re-workings of his previous themes. In turn, he occasionally reused materials from these pieces in later compositions.</p>

				<p>In further accord with the flexible musical practices of the day, Handel and his publishers permitted, even encouraged, performance of solo sonatas on instruments other than those specified by the printed scores&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;flute, recorder, oboe, viola da gamba or violin, for example. That increased not only the size of their audience but the contents of their bank accounts.</p>

				<p><i>Solos for a German Flute a Hoboy (oboe) or Violin with a Thorough Bass for the Harpsichord or Bass Violin Compos&rsquo;d by Mr. Handel</i> (to give the collection its full, original title) was published as Handel&rsquo;s Op. 1 by John Walsh in London in 1732. It contains a set of twelve sonatas, for various solo instruments and continuo. The 1732 edition (which displays at the bottom of the title page, &lsquo;This is more Corect [sic] than the former Edition&rsquo;) was mostly reprinted from the plates of an earlier 1730 publication, titled <i>Sonates pour un Traversiere un Violon ou Hautbois con Basso continuo Compos&eacute;es par G.F. Handel</i>&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;purportedly in Amsterdam by Jeanne Roger, but now shown to have been a forgery by Walsh (dated well after Jeanne Roger&rsquo;s death in 1722). Some scholars have cast doubt on the authenticity of several of the sonatas.</p>

				<p>They are entirely conventional in form, following the alternating pattern of brief slow and fast movements that Italian composer Arcangelo Corelli had established earlier in the century for this type of piece. The sonata you will hear this evening probably dates from about 1750, and is widely considered to be Handel&rsquo;s final piece of chamber music. He incorporated quotations from several of his previous compositions, dating back anywhere from two to 40 years. It was not published during his lifetime.</p>

				<p>The first movement is slow in tempo and noble in character. The fugal second movement has vivacious energy to spare. After a third movement that displays a touching sense of pathos, Handel concludes the sonata with a joyous, dance-like finale.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;What, then, is the original value of Handel&rsquo;s sonatas?&rdquo; writes musicologist Tomislav Volek. &ldquo;The answer is, &lsquo;nothing more&rsquo; than his power of invention, the expressiveness of his subjects and his uniquely masterful composing for only two parts. With his modest tools, Handel masters the entire range of expression. His slow movements can be simple, tuneful and touching, or festive and full of pomp, or richly embellished, while the fast ones dance, gambol and entertain, or impress with their solid and skillful counterpoint. It was in this way that the ideal prototype of chamber music compositions was born in the early eighteenth century.&rdquo;</p>

				<p><b>Sonata No. 5 in F Major, Op. 24 ‘Spring’<br>Ludwig van Beethoven</b></p>

				<p>Since Beethoven played both piano and violin at a fully professional level, composing music for the two instruments together came quite naturally to him. His ten sonatas for violin and piano are cornerstones of the repertoire. Earlier, such as in many of Mozart&rsquo;s sonatas for this pair of instruments, the piano dominated the violin. Beethoven fully established the instruments as equal partners in this type of piece.</p>

				<p>The creation of the violin sonatas spanned his middle and late periods, from 1798 to 1812. He composed sonatas Nos. 4 and 5 in 1801. That year also witnessed the inception of Piano Sonatas Nos. 9 and 12 to 15, and the ballet <i>The Creatures of Prometheus</i>.</p>

				<p>Sonatas Nos. 4 and 5 are quite different in character. No. 4 in A Minor is dark and dramatic, while No. 5 is relaxed, bright and sunny&mdash;the source of its anonymous but entirely appropriate nickname, &lsquo;Spring.&rsquo; It forecasted the warm, genial personalities of such other Beethoven works to come as the Pastoral Symphony (No. 6), Violin Concerto, and Piano Concerto No. 4.</p>

				<p>It is the first of the violin sonatas to have four movements rather than three, although the third movement, a whimsical scherzo and trio, is so brief that it&rsquo;s over almost before it begins. The first movement is founded on a pair of gracefully flowing themes, yet Beethoven still finds room within it for displays of power and thrust. The piano introduces the aristocratic theme of the second movement, which is a relaxed, murmuring reverie. The concluding rondo maintains the sonata&rsquo;s genial personality, steering clear of virtuosic display in favour of lyrical, Mozartean entertainment. A few short, ingeniously placed passages of violin pizzicati add a delectable touch.</p>
