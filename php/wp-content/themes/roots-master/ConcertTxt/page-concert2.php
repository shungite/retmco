		<h4><div>Discover two symphonies<br>with Anne Manson</div></h4>
		<p>MCO Music Director and Conductor Anne Manson will juxtapose two symphonies on this program, and will preface each with its story.</p>
		<p>One of Joseph Haydn&rsquo;s last symphonies, the 103rd was first performed in 1795. It is nicknamed &lsquo;The Drumroll&rsquo; after the long roll on the timpani with which it begins. A review of the premiere in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> reported &ldquo;continual strokes of genius, both in air and harmony.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Sketches of Beethoven&rsquo;s first symphony have been found from that very year. In the work of the young composer can be heard the influence of his teacher &mdash; Joseph Haydn &mdash; and other predecessors, including Mozart. It&rsquo;s definitely Beethoven, however, and with it, the young master burst onto the scene in 1800 Vienna.</p>
		<p>The first and (almost) last symphonies of two masters in one sitting! We’ll leave it to Anne
		to break it down.</p>
		<p><b>When composers clash</b></p>
		<p>&ldquo;... the issue surfaced most notably upon the publication of Beethoven&rsquo;s first compositions, the Op. 1 piano trios. Wishing to assist the young composer, Haydn suggested that Beethoven include the phrase &lsquo;pupil of Haydn&rsquo; underneath his name in order to garner advantage from Haydn&rsquo;s considerable fame. Beethoven bristled.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>According to the account left by Beethoven&rsquo;s pupil Ferdinand Ries, &ldquo;Beethoven was unwilling to because, as he said, although he had some instruction from Haydn he had never learned anything from him. However, at the old composer&rsquo;s 76th, he knelt down before Haydn and fervently kissed the hands and forehead of his old teacher.&rdquo;</p>

				<p><b>Symphony No. 1 in C Major, Op. 21<br>Ludwig van Beethoven</b></p>
				<p>Beethoven&rsquo;s genius illuminated every significant musical form, but perhaps the symphony more than any other. The nine symphonies form the very foundation of the standard orchestral repertoire. Through the human journey they chart, demonstrating his progress from gifted novice to supreme master, and drawing us irresistibly in to make the journey with him, they proclaim his gifts as clearly and with as much force as anything he created.</p>
				<p>He began but abandoned two symphonies before completing the official No. 1. During his youth in Bonn, he made sketches for the first movement of a symphony in C Minor. Then in 1795‑96, during his early years in Vienna (and perhaps under the inspiration of Haydn&rsquo;s final six symphonies, which had premiered in London between February 1794 and May 1795, and had recently been heard in Vienna for the first time), he did a great deal of work on a piece in C Major. Materials from it eventually found their way into the actual First Symphony, which is set in the same key.</p>
				<p>He then backed away from symphonic writing for a time. He committed himself fully in this direction only when two significant, coincidental moments in time were near at hand: his thirtieth birthday and the dawn of the nineteenth century. By that time he had amassed enough experience and self‑confidence to begin making his own contributions to this illustrious pursuit. </p>
				<p>His first two examples, whose debuts took place in 1800 and 1803, follow to some degree the patterns laid down by Haydn and Mozart, but not slavishly. As musicologist Ernest Newman has put it, &ldquo;New wine is poured into the old bottles; the mind at work has a greater fund of sheer energy; the music in general has a stronger musculature, so to speak, in virtue of which it goes as lightly on its feet as its models had done notwithstanding its greater bulk and weight.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>The natures of Beethoven&rsquo;s first two symphonies reflected the previous decades, when symphonies served primarily as curtain raisers for concerts whose most popular elements were solo turns by singers and instrumental virtuosos. One of Beethoven’s most significant achievements was to gradually shift a concert&rsquo;s centre of artistic gravity toward the orchestral symphony. In so doing, he also gradually raised it to the status of the most substantial and individual form in which composers could work.</p>
				<p>At the time when he composed his first two symphonies, however, his major innovations still lay ahead of him. He intended that these pieces should simply please his public, and that they should demonstrate his ability to create in this form. They fulfill these modest ambitions admirably. For modern listeners, they also provide fascinating glimpses of the master’s creative gifts in their early stages, as well as occasional hints of the powerful emotions to be heard in his later music. He dedicated No. 1 to Baron Gottfried van Swieten, a Viennese diplomat and music lover.</p>
				<p>He began the first movement (the embarkation point for the glorious voyage that would conclude more than two decades later with the <i>Ode to Joy</i>) with the kind of introduction in slow tempo that Haydn had used in his late symphonies &mdash; but with added twists that clearly mark it as the work of another composer. It&rsquo;s as if Beethoven were saying &ldquo;Here I am!&rdquo; A vigorous movement proper follows. The second movement, with a tempo marking of Andante (at a walking pace) is an amiable stroll, sprinkled with strong dynamic contrasts and much expressive writing for woodwinds.</p>
				<p>The following minuet is the symphony&rsquo;s most innovative section. Though it follows the strict three‑part structure that Beethoven inherited, it contains more energy and robust humour than anyone&rsquo;s previous example. It strongly forecasts Beethoven&rsquo;s later freewheeling symphonic scherzos, the first of which would appear soon afterwards in the Second Symphony. The finale of No. 1 opens with another slow introduction. But since this one is only five‑and‑a‑half bars long, it serves simply as a tease for the cheerful, comic-opera galop that follows.</p>
				<p><b>Symphony No. 103 in E-flat Major &mdash; &lsquo;Drum Roll&rsquo;<br>Joseph Haydn</b></p>
				<p>The officials of Bonn, Beethoven&rsquo;s native city, thought so highly of his musical gifts that in 1792, five years after his first visit to Vienna, they paid to send him there once again. The plan this time was for him to take lessons from the most renowned composer of the day, Joseph Haydn. A short time earlier, during a stopover in Bonn, the older master had examined a cantata by Beethoven and had expressed his interest and approval. </p>
				<p>Beethoven&rsquo;s admirers sent him on his way with many good wishes, including these prophetic words from Count Waldstein: &ldquo;The Genius of Mozart is still mourning and weeping over the death of her pupil. She found a refuge but no occupation with the inexhaustible Haydn; through him she wishes once more to form a union with another. With the help of assiduous labour you shall receive Mozart&rsquo;s spirit from Haydn&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Beethoven&rsquo;s intention was merely to complete his musical education in Vienna, before returning to live and work in Bonn. Circumstances, his magnificent talents in particular, led him to change those plans. </p>
				<p>The teacher-student relationship between Haydn and Beethoven proved less than ideal. On the surface it remained cordial (Beethoven dedicated the three piano sonatas which make up his Op. 2 to Haydn), but beneath it ran the side effects caused by the clash between their vastly different personalities. Beethoven&rsquo;s lessons ended after little more than a year, in the spring of 1794, when Haydn embarked on his second trip to England.</p>
				<p>The pupil&rsquo;s summing up of the whole affair was typically brusque: &ldquo;Though I had some instruction from Haydn, I never learned anything from him.&rdquo; Beethoven&rsquo;s early music, however, tells a different story. Typically, Haydn&rsquo;s comments on his headstrong student were more genteel, yet still penetrating in their insight. He once referred to Beethoven as &lsquo;The Great Mogul.&rsquo; On another occasion he remarked to him, &ldquo;You make upon me the impression of a man who has several heads, several hearts and several souls.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>When considering Haydn, it&rsquo;s easy to get bogged down in statistics. He composed more than 100 symphonies, 70-plus string quartets, 50 piano sonatas, etc. Haydn himself had a brief chat on this very issue with King George III of England. &ldquo;Dr. Haydn, you have written a great deal,&rdquo; the king said. &ldquo;Yes, sire, a great deal more than is good,&rdquo; Haydn replied. &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; the king said quickly, &ldquo;the world contradicts that.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>It is much more rewarding to consider the quality of Haydn&rsquo;s music, rather than the quantity. In creating so much, he could easily have lapsed into routine. But practically every work has some, or many touches of individuality and imagination, something that lifts it above the routine. And he never failed to provide first-class entertainment. </p>
				<p>Prince Nicholas Esterházy, the fabulously wealthy Hungarian aristocrat who had been Haydn&rsquo;s employer for nearly 30 years, died in 1790. Because his successor, Prince Anton Esterh&aacute;zy, was far less interested in music, he discontinued much of the family&rsquo;s artistic activities. Nominally, Haydn remained on the payroll. But in fact he was finally free to move about and enjoy the fame his music had won for him during the years he was a virtual prisoner on the Esterh&aacute;zy estates.</p>
				<p>He quickly relocated in Vienna and began considering which of the many travel invitations he would accept. The list of choices included Naples and Pressburg. The offer that he settled upon came from a forthright individual who turned up one day on his doorstep. Johann Peter Salomon was a successful German‑born impresario and violinist based in England. &ldquo;I am Salomon of London and have come to fetch you,&rdquo; he said bluntly to Haydn. &ldquo;Tomorrow we will arrange an accord.&rdquo; And so they did!</p>
				<p>Haydn made two visits to England, in 1791/92 and 1794/95. They won enormous success, in terms of both art and commerce. His contemporary biographer, Georg Griesinger, wrote that &ldquo;Haydn considered the days he spent in England the happiest of his life. He was everywhere appreciated there; it opened a new world to him, and he could, through his rich earnings, at last escape the restricted circumstances in which he had grown grey.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>For those trips, he composed 12 new symphonies, six for each season. Believing that with them he had made his finest statements in this field of composition &mdash; one which he had done so much to develop &mdash; he decided to write no more such works. In the 14 years remaining to him, he concentrated on vocal music, such as the oratorios <i>The Creation</i> and <i>The Seasons</i>.</p>
				<p>His second season of concerts in London caused even greater excitement and enthusiasm than the first. Audiences believed they were witnessing the activities of the greatest living composer, and flocked to hear his latest creations. The premieres of the final three symphonies (Nos. 102 to 104) took place in the newly completed, 3300-seat concert hall of the Haymarket Theatre, and involved an orchestra of more than 60 players. </p>
				<p>Symphony No. 103 debuted there on 2 March 1795. Following the custom of the day, the direction was shared between the composer, seated at a keyboard at the back of the orchestra, and the concertmaster at the front of the violin section. By that time Salomon had withdrawn, to be replaced as producer of the events and concertmaster by the eminent Italian violinist, Giovanni Battista Viotti.</p>
				<p>Symphony No. 103 is saturated with authentic folk tunes. Here and elsewhere, Haydn effortlessly, ingeniously and respectfully integrated such &lsquo;popular&rsquo; material into art music. </p>
				<p>Many of his symphonies have acquired nicknames, but hardly any of them originated with him. The opening bars of No. 103 are the source of its nickname. After the timpani roll has captured your attention, Haydn continues with a slow, almost sinister introduction, like a prelude to the executions by guillotine that had recently been taking place in post-revolutionary France. It turns out to be a set-up, one of Haydn&rsquo;s many musical jokes, since the shadows it casts are abruptly banished by the start of the bright and energetic movement proper. </p>
				<p>The teasing first theme, which the nineteenth-century Croatian ethnomusicologist Franjo Kuha&#269; identified as one of his homeland&rsquo;s folk tunes, is closely related to the music of the introduction. The second theme is a delightful waltz, a dance form just then coming into favour. The introduction reappears towards the end, just to remind us that rain clouds can blow in suddenly even on the sunniest of days.</p>
				<p>The next movement is an ingenious and charming set of variations. Based on a pair of close-cousin Croatian folk melodies, it continues the opening movement’s swift alteration of light and dark emotions. The extended, elegant violin solo may represent a tribute, and an opportunity for display, offered by the composer to his concertmaster. </p>
				<p>A stately minuet follows, in whose outer sections may be heard clear echoes of Alpine yodeling. The central trio section spotlights the clarinets. This instrument had enjoyed only limited exposure in London, and Haydn had only recently begun to include it in his symphonic orchestra: in No. 99 (1793), to be exact. </p>
				<p>No. 103 concludes with a swift, witty finale. Haydn based it on a single theme, another Croatian folk tune. This procedure resulted in, to quote the eminent classical period scholar, H.C. Robbins Landon, &ldquo;a tighter construction and a more relentless unity than any movement before the first movement of Beethoven’s Fifth.&rdquo; Haydn enjoyed such challenges to his ingenuity, and he met this one with not only imagination but also immense joy.</p>

						<h4>Review:<br />The sound of education</h4>
						<h5>MCO serves up context to go with concept program of Hadyn, Beethoven</h5>
						<p class="fineprintdark"><a href="http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/">Winnipeg Free Press</a>, by Holly Harris<br />Manitoba Chamber Orchestra; Anne Manson, conductor<br />Westminster United Church; Tue, Oct 22<br />Attendance: 650<br>Three stars out of five<br>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>The Manitoba Chamber Orchestra offered up an intriguing discourse on the unique relationship between pupil and teacher and master composer and emerging musical genius with its latest concert that juxtaposed two symphonic works by elder composer Haydn and his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Beethoven.</p>
						<p>Despite their relationship being fraught with discord, Beethoven&rsquo;s early music displays &lsquo;Papa&rsquo; Haydn&rsquo;s influence as well as the seeds of greatness that culminated with his iconic Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125, popularly known as the &lsquo;Choral.&rsquo;</p>
						<p>Tuesday night&rsquo;s quasi-lecture-demonstration included MCO music director Anne Manson setting up each of the two programmed works, contextualizing with anecdotes, historical snippets, and even a few quotes by music critics of the day. Albeit fascinating, it&rsquo;s a fair guess that many in the crowd of 650 may not have always followed the compare-and-contrast analyses of musical motives, harmonic progressions and thematic material.</p>
						<p>The concert opened with Haydn&rsquo;s Symphony No. 103 in E-flat major, the penultimate work of his 12 London Symphonies composed during 1794-95, as well as astonishing canon of 104 symphonies. Nicknamed &lsquo;The Drumroll,&rsquo; the four-movement work begins with an extended timpani roll that underscores the mostly lighthearted work with ominous tension.</p>
						<p>The expanded orchestra &mdash; including added winds, brass and percussion, with the famous roll ably performed by Jeremy Epp &mdash; was a special treat to hear in the intimate venue. Kudos also to concertmaster Karl Stobbe for his gracefully rendered solo during the Andante più tosto allegretto, as he performed the embellished, Croatian folk song-inspired theme with confident, elegant clarity.</p>
						<p>The second half of the concert featured Beethoven&rsquo;s Symphony No. 1, in C Major, Op. 21 &mdash; begun the same year as the 1795 Haydn premiere &mdash; that heralded the arrival of a new musical voice during its debut five years later.</p>
						<p>After the first movement&rsquo;s Adagio molto introduction, Manson attacked the Allegro con brio with gusto, leading the players through its musical twists and turns, including rugged sforzandi &mdash; this composer&rsquo;s hallmark. Following the Andante cantabile con moto, she then kept a firm baton on the Menuetto that sets off on its own rollicking extrapolation of the opening motives. The orchestra then delivered the finale: Adagio bleeding into the Allegro molto e vivace at lightning speed, earning whoops and a standing ovation for the nail-biting performance.</p>
						<p>The MCO has carved out a reputation as one of this country&rsquo;s leading chamber orchestras, with an impressive legacy of artistic risk-taking, including commissioning numerous new works by 21st-century Canadian composers. This particular &lsquo;concept&rsquo; program, decidedly conservative despite Manson&rsquo;s enthusiasm, provided an evening of classics for those waxing nostalgic for the 18th century.</p>
