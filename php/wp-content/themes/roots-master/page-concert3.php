		<h4>Pianistic might,<br />for mighty music: Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin</h4>
		<p>&ldquo;A one-of-a-kind concert artist ... his rhythms were so exacting and his touch so subtle that each note seemed to have a life of its own.&rdquo; So says the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>. We knew that!</p>
		<p>Piano star Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin has appeared with the MCO four times over the years; we always want him back and, happily, he always wants to return to Winnipeg and our stage!</p>
		<p>Hamelin is equally at home with traditional and contemporary repertoire as we&rsquo;ll see on this concert. Shostakovich virtually invented the piano concerto anew when he first penned this razor-sharp and minimalist work in 1933, and we can&rsquo;t wait to hear the work in Hamelin&rsquo;s hands.</p>
		<p>For the first time ever we&rsquo;ll present a work by American composer Dorothy Chang. Described as &ldquo;evocative and kaleidoscopic&rdquo; by the <em>Seattle Times</em>, her music is characterized by an emphasis on dramatic intensity and expressive lyricism.</p>
		<strong>The concert begins at 7:30 pm on January 9th in <a href="http://www.westminsterchurchwinnipeg.ca">Westminster United Church</a>, 745 Westminster at Maryland. Tickets are $26.50 for adults, $24.50 for seniors and $7.50 for students, including GST, at <a href="http://www.mcnallyrobinson.com/home" title="McNally Robinson">McNally Robinson</a>, the <a href="http://www.wecc.ca/" title="West End Cultural Centre">West End Cultural Centre</a> (586 Ellice at Sherbrook), <a href="http://www.organicplanet.coop/" title="Organic Planet">Organic Planet</a> (877 Westminster Ave) or MCO's Ticketline (783-7377).</strong>

				<p><strong>Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin</strong></p>
				<p>Pianist Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin&rsquo;s unique blend of musicianship and virtuosity brings forth interpretations remarkable for their freedom, originality and prodigious mastery of the piano&rsquo;s resources. A musician of broad musical interests and curiosity, Hamelin is renowned in equal measure for his fresh readings of the established repertoire and for his exploration of lesser known works of the 19th and 20th centuries, both in the recording studio and in the concert hall.</p>
				<p>This season Hamelin performs Haydn piano concerti with Les Violons du Roy and Bernard Labadie (which will be recorded for release on Hyperion), Beethoven&rsquo;s Piano Concerto No. 4 with the Tonhalle-Orchester Zurich and David Zinman, the Atlanta Symphony and Hugh Wolff, and the National Arts Centre in Ottawa led by Ainars Ribikis. He joins the National Philharmonic of Russia and Vladimir Spivakov for concerti by Rubinstein and Medtner, appears with the San Francisco Symphony with David Robertson playing Ravel and Gershwin &mdash; and also performs with the Columbus Symphony and the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra. Mr. Hamelin will tour Canada and the US performing the Shostakovich Piano Quintet with the Takacs String Quartet and will appear in recital in cities including New York (where he will perform the premiere in that city of his Variations on a Theme by Paganini), Chicago, Vancouver, London, Berlin, Lisbon, Munich, Stuttgart, Moscow and Antwerp.</p>
				<p>During the summer of 2012 Marc-Andr&eacute; opened the Aspen Music Festival season with Robert Spano leading the orchestra in Gershwin&rsquo;s Rhapsody in Blue and returned in recital. He also performed in Seattle, Montr&eacute;al, Aix-en-Provence and in Helsingborg, where, in conjunction with serving on the jury of the Edvard Grieg Piano Competition, he performed a recital at Grieg&rsquo;s home, Troldhaugen. In 2012 he opened the season at the BBC Proms with a late night recital of Liszt works and with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. He debuted with Berliner Philharmoniker and appeared with other major symphony European orchestras. In North America, he performed with the orchestras of Chicago, Montr&eacute;al, Qu&eacute;bec and Seattle. He also performed the epic Busoni Piano Concerto throughout the season both in Europe and North America.  In recent seasons, Hamelin has performed with orchestra and in solo recital at the Lincoln Center, the various stages of Carnegie Hall and on an international tour of the Schumann Piano Quintet with the Takacs Quartet. </p>
				<p>Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin records exclusively for Hyperion Records. His most recent releases include Reger and Strauss concerti with the Runfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin and a solo disc of works by Liszt; the latter was selected by Bryce Morrison for Gramophone&rsquo;s 2011 &lsquo;Critics&rsquo; Choice&rsquo; feature. An album of his own compositions, <em>Hamelin: Etudes</em>, received a 2010 Grammy nomination (his ninth) and a first prize from the German Record Critics&rsquo; Association. His discography includes concertos and works for solo piano by composers such as Alkan, Busoni, Godowsky and Medtner, as well as brilliantly received performances of Brahms, Chopin, Haydn, Liszt and Schumann.</p>
				<p>A resident of Boston Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin is the recipient of a lifetime achievement prize by the German Record Critics&rsquo; Association and is an Officer of the Order of Canada, a Chevalier de l&rsquo;Ordre du Qu&eacute;bec, and a member of the Royal Society of Canada.</p>
				<p><strong>Guy Few</strong></p>
				<p>Guy Few is a virtuoso. As a pianist, trumpeter, cornist, and singer, he delights audiences with his intensity and charm. Montreal's Le Devoir calls him &ldquo;outrageously gifted&rdquo; and &ldquo;quite simply phenomenal.&rdquo; It is no wonder that he is in demand as a soloist, performing with many orchestras and festivals in Canada and the USA. Guy is equally at home in classical or contemporary genres. Through the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the Canada Council and the Ontario Arts Council, he has debuted new works by Canadian composers including Glen Buhr, Peter Hatch, Alain Trudel, Melissa Hui, Mathieu Lussier, Linda Bouchard, Boyd McDonald, Jacques Hétu and many others. He has recorded for S.N.E., Arsis Classics, CBC Musica Viva, CBC SM5000, ibs, Naxos, MSR and the H&auml;nssler Classics labels. Recording awards include a Grammy for Credo of Penderecki (Hanssler) with the Oregon Bach Festival Orchestra, Helmuth Rilling conductor and a Just Plain Folks Music Award &mdash; Best Classical Orchestral Recording, 2009 for Bacchanale (MSR). Recent CD releases include Romanza, with Nadina Mackie Jackson and The Toronto Chamber Orchestra, Nicholas McGegan conductor, (MSR Classics).</p>
				<p>Guy has been invited as a professor, adjudicator, soloist, principal and recitalist to many festivals including Festival of the Sound, Scotiafest, Orford Festival, National Music Festival, Ottawa Chamber Music Festival, Vancouver Chamber Festival, Elora Festival, Tanglewood, Takefu International Music Festival and Oregon Bach Festival. Clinics and master classes have been presented worldwide for festivals including Scotiafest, Takefu International Music Festival, Orford Arts Centre and the Banff Centre for the Arts, as well as post-secondary institutions such as the Montreal Conservatory, University of Toronto, Memorial University of Newfoundland, State University of New York at Fredonia and Sonoma State University.</p>
				<p>Guy is a gold medal graduate of Wilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo, Ontario, and holds a Fellowship Diploma from Trinity College, London, England. He performs and records on a regular basis with Nadina Mackie Jackson (bassoon), Stephanie Mara (piano) and Bellows and Brass. New groups include Project Aria with Donna Brown, Leslie Fagan and Stephanie Mara. Guy has appeared on CBC-TV, CTV, BRAVO, TV5 and European television broadcasts and is heard regularly on CBC Radio, Classical 96.3 and NPR.</p>
				<p>Guy is a part time faculty member at Wilfrid Laurier University where he teaches trumpet and chamber music. Guy is a Yamaha artist.</p>
				<p><strong>Dorothy Chang</strong></p>
				<p>Described as “evocative and kaleidoscopic” (<em>Seattle Times</em>), the music of Dorothy Chang is characterized by an emphasis on dramatic intensity and expressive lyricism, with a more recent interest in interdisciplinary works involving video, imagery and movement.</p>
				<p>Her music has been performed by orchestras including the Albany (NY) Symphony, Aspen Concert Orchestra, Chicago Civic Orchestra, Indianapolis Symphony, Queens Symphony, Seattle Symphony, Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, Vancouver Island and Vancouver Symphony, as well as by chamber ensembles including eighth blackbird, the Smith Quartet (UK), the Chicago Saxophone Quartet, Collage New Music (Boston), North/South Consonance (New York), Music from China, and Soundstreams (Toronto). It has been featured in concerts and festivals across North America and abroad, most recently at the PAN Music Festival (Seoul), Lontano Festival (UK), and World Music Days in Hong Kong.</p>
				<p>Awards and honours that Dorothy has received include a Charles Ives Scholarship from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, awards from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, the International Alliance for Women in Music, Mu Phi Epsilon, the National Society of Arts and Letters, Meet the Composer and the Jacob Druckman Orchestra Prize from the Aspen Music Festival. She has received commissions from the Canada Council of the Arts, the British Columbia Arts Council, the Barlow Endowment, Chamber Music America, and the Mary Flagler Cary Charitable Trust.  For the 2003/04 and 2005–08 seasons, Dorothy held a Music Alive composer residency with the Albany Symphony Orchestra.</p>
				<p>In 2008, she was awarded the inaugural commission from the Women&rsquo;s Philharmonic Commissioning Project of Meet the Composer, for a new orchestral work, Strange Air, which was premiered at the Cabrillo Festival  of Contemporary Music by conductor Marin Alsop and the festival orchestra.</p>
				<p>Born in Winfield, Illinois, Dorothy began her music studies on piano at age six, and began composing at the age of fourteen. She received degrees in composition from the University of Michigan (B.M., M.M.) and the Indiana University School of Music (D.M). She has served on the music faculty at Indiana State University, and is currently Associate Professor of Music at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.</p>
				<p><strong>Jos&eacute; Evangelista</strong></p>
				<p>Jos&eacute; Evangelista pursues an artistic path by which he has explored ways of making a music based exclusively on melody. Hence, he has developed a heterophonic writing, both for instruments and orchestra, in which the melodic line generates echoes of itself and creates an illusion of polyphony. His music draws its roots from an enlarged vision of tradition: to his Spanish origins he has added the influences of the Indonesian gamelan, the Western avant-garde and modal music.</p>
				<p>Evangelista was born in Valencia, Spain, in 1943. He began his musical studies with Vicente Asencio while simultaneously studying physics. Later work in computers led him to Canada. Settling in Montr&eacute;al in 1970, he studied composition with Andr&eacute; Pr&eacute;vost and Bruce Mather. From 1979 to 2009 he was a professor at the University of Montr&eacute;al, where he created the Balinese Gamelan Workshop in 1987. He has been a founding member of several concert societies, has received a number of awards, and commissions from, among others, Itin&eacute;raire (Paris), the Kronos Quartet, the Groupe vocal de France, SMCQ and the CBC. His works have been performed in Canada, the US, Europe, Asia and Australia by groups such as Ensemble Modern (Frankfurt), the Nieuw Ensemble (Amsterdam), Music Projects (London), the Orchestre philharmonique de Radio-France, the Montr&eacute;al Symphony Orchestra, I Musici de Montr&eacute;al, Esprit Orchestra and the Nouvel Ensemble Moderne (Montr&eacute;al). Between 1993 and 1995 he was composer-in-residence with the Montr&eacute;al Symphony Orchestra. He has premiered two operas: Exercices de conversation (Lyon 2000, libretto by Eugène Ionesco) and Manuscrit trouv&eacute; à Saragosse (Montr&eacute;al 2001, libretto by Alexis Nouss after Jan Potocki). Recent compositions include a concerto for the Montr&eacute;al cellist, Velitchka Yotcheva, and a piece for guitarist David Russell. He is also writing a book on heterophony.</p>

				<p><strong>Virtuosities (2012)<br />Dorothy Chang</strong></p>
				<p>In honour of the 40th anniversary season of the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra, I was inspired to write a work that celebrates music history and tradition while also embracing the new and innovative &mdash; something that the MCO has so successfully accomplished throughout its forty years.  <em>Virtuosities</em> seeks to draw connections between the music of the past and present, either through points of intersection or through sharply contrasting juxtaposition.</p>
				<p>In the first movement, <em>To dream, perchance to fly</em>, a lightning-fast tempo and continuous swirls of rising figures are meant to create a breathless, whirlwind energy, referencing elements of Baroque virtuosity within a contemporary context. The intimate and lyrical second movement, <em>Souvenir</em>, features the beautiful simplicity of a straightforward melody-and-background texture, enriched with an expanded sound palette of distinct colours and timbres. In the final movement, <em>Mechanica</em>, an energetic walking bass serves a constant driving pulse over which a hodgepodge of various short quotes and other musical references are spliced, layered and woven together.
				<p><strong>Piano Concerto in D Major, HOB.XVIII:11<br />Joseph Haydn</strong></p>
				<p>During Haydn&rsquo;s lifetime, the piano gradually replaced the harpsichord as the dominant keyboard instrument. He composed more than a dozen concertos for keyboard. It is difficult to determine if he intended them to be performed on harpsichord or piano, but they make an equally superb effect on either instrument.</p>
				<p>This concerto, probably the last of the series, was published in 1784. Beyond that, its history remains cloudy. Haydn may have composed it for performance on the estates of his royal composer, Prince Nicolaus Esterházy, or for either of two celebrated Austrian soloists: the renowned virtuoso, Maria Theresia Paradis (who certainly performed &ldquo;a new concerto by Haydn&rdquo; in Paris in 1784), and Fräulein von Hartenstein. Some evidence points to Hartenstein&rsquo;s performing it in Vienna as early as 1780.</p>
				<p>It proved quickly to be exceptionally popular. No fewer than eight publishers in several countries brought out editions of it during its first decade in print, and during Haydn&rsquo;s lifetime it received more performances than any of his other concertos. </p>
				<p>Reflecting the fact that Haydn was not a keyboard virtuoso, it demands more in terms of fluency, warmth and taste than technical brilliance. It may lack some of the depth of thought and the richness of instrumentation of his friend Mozart&rsquo;s piano concertos (or those of his pupil, Beethoven), a fact that has limited its appeal to soloists. Nevertheless it is a highly attractive and satisfying work. </p>
				<p>During the 1770s, Haydn&rsquo;s major responsibility for the Prince had been the two opera theatres that the Esterh&aacute;zys maintained. He composed original operas, and selected, produced and conducted operas by all the prominent theatre composers of the day. All this exposure and experience influenced his purely instrumental music. A comparison between this concerto and his previous examples reveals that his themes had become more melodious, and he developed them on a broader scale.</p>
				<p>The opening movement of this concerto is energetic and virtually carefree. The second movement is a calm, restful reverie. The finale is the main source of the concerto&rsquo;s popularity. It is a vivacious rondo, based on an authentic Hungarian or Bosnian-Dalmatian folk tune. This is an early example of a practice through which numerous Austro-German composers, through to Brahms, gave their audiences a delightful taste of the exotic.</p>
				<p><strong>Concerto con brio<br />José Evangelista</strong></p>
				<p><em>The composer has provided the following note:</em></p>
				<p>This concerto-like work for string quartet and string orchestra was inspired by the music of Vivaldi. I have always admired, among other things, this grand master&rsquo;s capacity to create music that is totally immediate, filled with energy and imagination, yet completely at the service of its rather restrained melodic and harmonic materials, often with a disarming simplicity. In this piece, I have tried to capture that spirit &mdash; hence the title. It follows classical models and the movements are called Direct, Mélismatique and Presto. The first alternates an orchestral ritornello and a rhythmic theme for the soloists. The second has the spirit of an improvisation. The third presents very simple instrumental motives which give it the character of a perpetual motion.</p>
				<p><strong>Concerto in C Minor<br />for Piano, Trumpet &amp; String Orchestra<br />(Piano Concerto No. 1), Op. 35<br />Dmitri Shostakovich</strong></p>
				<p>The young Shostakovich developed his skill as a pianist to the point where he won entry to the 1927 Chopin Competition in Warsaw. He held high hopes of taking first prize, only to undergo bitter disappointment when he received merely a diploma. Smarting from this public humiliation, he decided to abandon any hope of a solo career and concentrate on composing instead. His vow soon evaporated, however, and, finding his spirits revived by the completion of his opera <em>Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk</em> in 1932, he returned to public performing.</p>
				<p>He also composed new works to play. First he wrote a set of preludes for solo piano, then in 1933 the first of his two piano concertos. He gave the première in Leningrad in October with Fritz Stiedry conducting. He performed it many more times and recorded it, together with Concerto No. 2, in France in 1958.</p>
				<p>He scored the accompaniment for string orchestra and trumpet. He considered the brass part so important that whenever he performed the concerto he had the trumpet player sit beside him, rather than in the orchestra.</p>
				<p>In sharp contrast to the darkly dramatic opera <em>Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk</em>, the concerto&rsquo;s principal characteristic is humour &mdash; occasionally subtle, more often not. Technical demands are high as well, as every player is called upon to perform in a brilliant manner.</p>
				<p>Shostakovich doesn&rsquo;t neglect to provide contrast, however. The slow second movement is an oasis of serenity and warmth in the midst of the generally brittle, satiric and rowdy goings‑on, which recall the times he spent playing the piano to accompany silent comedies in a Leningrad cinema during his youth. On another front, he directed that the last three of the four sections be performed without pauses between them. This desire for continuity within his compositions became a regular feature of his music.</p>
				<p>Conductor Yuli Turovsky has related an amusing anecdote regarding this concerto, one that has achieved legendary status in the annals of the Moscow Conservatory. &ldquo;After a performance in Moscow,” he writes, &ldquo;almost all of the city&rsquo;s most prominent musicians assembled in Shostakovich&rsquo;s dressing room to congratulate him. One of them, a well-known pianist and professor of the conservatory, was renowned among other things for his caustic tongue. While congratulating Shostakovich, but not wanting to miss an opportunity to be sarcastic, he said, &lsquo;A remarkable concerto, but tell me Dmitri Dmitrievich, why does your first theme begin like Beethoven&rsquo;s Appassionata Sonata?&rsquo; According to the legend, Shostakovich answered in his quick, nervous speech, &lsquo;That indeed is so; you see, I wrote it so that any idiot could understand it!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

							<h4>La Libert&eacute;:<br />La joie du clavier</h4>
							<p class="fineprintdark">Classement de l&rsquo;article, <em>La Libert&eacute;</em>, 2 janvier 2013, Daniel BAHUAUD</p>
							<p>Pour le pianiste virtuose Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin, jouer les concertos de Chostakovitch et d&rsquo;haydn est une occasion de red&eacutecouvrir de vieux amis et de partager des tr&eacute;sors musicaux avec le public manitobain.</p>
							<p>&laquo;Lorsqu&rsquo;on reçoit une invitation de l&rsquo;Orchestre de chambre du Manitoba (OCM), c&rsquo;est tr&egrave;s difficile, voire impossible, de la refuser, lance le pianiste Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin. Les musiciens sont professionnels et passionn&eacute;s de la musique. De plus, la vision de l&rsquo;orchestre, qui allie ouvrages bien connus aux sentiers musicaux moins battus, cadre bien avec la mienne. D&rsquo;o&ugrave; le plaisir que j&rsquo;aurai &agrave; interpr&eacute;ter Chostakovitch et Haydn avec ces musiciens, le 9 janvier. &raquo;</p>
							<p>De fait, il s&rsquo;agira de la cinqui&egrave;me performance effectu&eacute;e par le pianiste virtuose et compositeur qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois avec le MCO. &laquo; J&rsquo;adore Winnipeg, d&eacute;clare le musicien. L&rsquo;exp&eacute;rience de jouer un concert où le compas musical est tr&egrave;s &eacute;tendu sera tr&egrave;s agr&eacute;able, puisque j&rsquo;aime les contrastes. &raquo;</p>
							<p>N&rsquo;empêche que le Concerto num&eacute;ro 2 en R&eacute; de Franz Joseph Haydn et le Concerto en Do mineur de Dmitri Chostakovitch se jumellent bien ensemble, puisque ces ouvrages permettront au public de constater l&rsquo;&eacute;volution du concerto du 18e au 20e si&egrave;cle. Compos&eacute; en 1933, le concerto de Chostakovitch se veut une r&eacute;invention de la formule de base du concerto.</p>
							<p>&laquo; C&rsquo;est l&rsquo;attrait principal de l&rsquo;ouvrage, explique Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin. Dans un concerto traditionnel, on expose deux th&egrave;mes pour ensuite les d&eacute;velopper tout au long d&rsquo;un mouvement. Or, celui de Chostakovitch pr&eacute;sente constamment de nouveaux th&egrave;mes. Un compositeur moins habile pourrait entreprendre cette approche bien maladroitement. Mais le sens de la structure et du d&eacute;roulement musical de Chostakovitch est tel, que ça marche.</p>
							<p>&laquo; En fait, toute l&rsquo;oeuvre met en valeur cet esprit d&rsquo;&eacute;clectisme, poursuit-il. Le contraste entre le mouvement lent et le 4e mouvement, qui est de la pure musique de cirque, est des plus frappants. Et puis la contribution de la trompette est tr&egrave;s importante. Au fond, c&rsquo;est une partie de soliste, qui contribue presque autant à son succ&egrave;s que le pianiste. Il faut avoir des musiciens solides pour cr&eacute;er l&rsquo;unit&eacute; musicale de ce concerto. Et je suis choy&eacute; que ce soit le trompettiste Guy Few qui a &eacute;t&eacute; choisi pour m&rsquo;accompagner dans ce voyage musical. &raquo;</p>
							<p>Quant au concerto plus traditionnel d&rsquo;Haydn, MarcAndr&eacute; Hamelin dit avoir hâte de red&eacute;couvrir &laquo; un vieil ami &raquo;. &laquo; Il y a toujours quelque chose à red&eacute;couvrir dans cette oeuvre, d&eacute;clare-t-il. C&rsquo;est plutôt miraculeux. Lorsque je le joue, c&rsquo;est comme enfiler un gant confortable. Mais l&rsquo;exp&eacute;rience de vie et la maturit&eacute; musicale font que ce n&rsquo;est plus tout à fait pareil. Et puisque le Haydn est moins difficile sur le plan pianistique, je pourrai davantage m&rsquo;abandonner à la joie de faire de la musique. &raquo;</p>
							<p>Outres les pi&egrave;ces mettant en vedette le pianiste Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin, le public aura droit &agrave; une interpr&eacute;tation du Concerto con brio de Jos&eacute; Evangelista, ainsi qu&rsquo;une toute nouvelle pi&egrave;ce de la compositrice am&eacute;ricaine, Dorothy Chang.</p>
							<p>&laquo; Ce sera agr&eacute;able de pouvoir d&eacute;couvrir une nouvelle oeuvre et de red&eacute;couvrir une pi&egrave;ce inhabituelle et inusit&eacute;e &raquo;, conclut Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin.</p>
