		<p><strong>Janina Fialkowska</strong></p>
		<p>Beloved worldwide, Janina Fialkowska has enchanted audiences for over thirty years, performing with all the foremost North American, European and Asian orchestras. Janina&rsquo;s career was launched in 1974 by Arthur Rubinstein after her prize-winning performance at his inaugural Master Piano Competition.</p>
		<p>Janina Fialkowska has won recognition most notably for the world premiere performance of a newly discovered piano concerto by Liszt. In 2010, Ms Fialkowska&rsquo;s three CDs of Chopin&rsquo;s music received stellar reviews worldwide. &ldquo;Indeed, lesser mortals may well weep with envy at such unfaltering authority.&rdquo; (Bryce Morrison in <em>Gramophone Magazine</em>.) In January 2002, Ms Fialkowska&rsquo;s career was brought to a dramatic halt by a tumour in her left arm. She had a rare muscle-transfer surgery a year later and was thankfully able to resume her extraordinary musical path.</p>
		<p>Janina Fialkowska is an Officer of the Order of Canada. She received the 2012 Governor General&rsquo;s Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Achievement in Classical Music.</p>
