						<strong>A brief history of<br />
						the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra</strong> 
					</p>
					<p>
						The MCO is &ldquo;Canada&rsquo;s tiny, perfect chamber orchestra&rdquo; (<em>Toronto Star</em>). 
					</p>
					<p>
						It has toured widely, commissions often, embraces a diverse repertoire, and collaborates regularly with the world&rsquo;s leading solo&not;ists, from James Ehnes to Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The orchestra, boasting a roster of some of the finest orchestral musicians in Canada, has been praised for its &ldquo;satiny sound&thinsp;&hellip;&thinsp;dynamic subtlety, and an impeccable sense of ensemble&rdquo; (<em>Ottawa Citizen</em>) and called &ldquo;an excellent string ensemble conducted with crispness and verve by Anne Manson&rdquo; (<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>). 
					</p>
					<p>
						Established in 1972, the MCO presents nine concerts annually in Winnipeg, most of which feature guest soloists, and all of which present an accessible, eclectic repertoire ranging from the mega-hits of the common practice tradition to exciting new premieres. The rest of its energies are devoted to unfolding an extensive program of touring, recording, and outreach every year. 
					</p>
					<p>
						In 1995, the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra became the first North American orchestra to release a record with Sweden&rsquo;s prestigious BIS label. Since then they&rsquo;ve recorded eight albums, two of which have earned Juno nominations (<em>So Much To Tell</em> with Measha Brueggergosman and <em>Troubadour &amp; the Nightingale</em> with Isabel Bayrakdarian). Their 2013 recording of Philip Glass music has enjoyed international acclaim. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Their first international tour was of Italy in 1999. Since then, highlight tour appearances include performing with Isabel Bayrakdarian at Carnegie Hall in 2008 in a spectacular concert that garnered three curtain calls. Another highlight was its ten-concert Western Canada tour in 2009 with Dame Evelyn Glennie, with whom they recorded an album and again toured in 2016. 
					</p>
					<p>
						In their 2017/18 45th anniversary season, the MCO tours British Columbia with leading Canadian cellist Ariel Barnes. The MCO is proud to have soprano Measha Brueggergosman join the MCO as guest artist-in-residence. Another season highlight includes their co-commission of a new concerto by Philip Glass, which they premiere in January 2018. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Notable among ongoing outreach initiatives is the &lsquo;Fiddlers on the Loose&rsquo; ensemble, taking live music to remote parts of the province, from Churchill to Grand Rapids, to work with and play for youth and families who face geographic and economic challenges. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Anne Manson was appointed Music Director of the MCO in 2008, succeeding Roy Goodman in the post. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The MCO operates on an annual budget of just under $1 million, and has worked hard to maintain a balanced budget for the past 21 consecutive years and to build an endowment for the future. It has nearly doubled the budget in the past ten years, helping to support its international touring performances and the growing province-wide youth program.
