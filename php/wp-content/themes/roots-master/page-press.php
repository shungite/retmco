				<p><strong>A brief history<br />of the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra</strong></p>
				<p>The Manitoba Chamber Orchestra explores the section of the repertoire rarely touched by large symphony orchestras. Established in 1972, the MCO presents an annual nine-concert subscription series in Winnipeg. Co-presentations with CBC Radio began in 1984, and Canadians across the country (roughly 3.7 million annually) and fans around the world enjoy the Orchestra in frequent broadcasts and online.</p>
				<p>In 1986 and 1993, the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra drew outstanding reviews for its performances at the Guelph Spring Festival. The MCO represented Manitoba at the Calgary Winter Olympics in 1988, and at the meeting of the Association of Canadian Orchestras in 1990 was presented with a SOCAN Award of Merit for ‘the imaginative programming of contemporary Canadian music.’</p>
				<p>In 1995 the MCO released its first compact disc on Sweden&rsquo;s BIS label; <em>Canadian Music for Chamber Orchestra</em> (CD 698) marked the first recording by a North American orchestra on the prestigious label and the disc was distributed in over 45 countries. There have been five subsequent recordings, four of them with CBC Records. The most recent was <em>So Much To Tell</em>, with Measha Brueggergosman.</p>
				<p>The MCO toured southern Italy in August, 1999, and British Columbia in the spring of 2003 and again in the autumn of 2009. It appeared on the live national broadcast of the Juno Awards in April, 2005. In the summer of 2008, it made its debut appearance at the National Arts Centre and performed for over 7,500 people on Canada Day at Harbourfront in Toronto. The MCO accompanied Canadian soprano Isabel Bayrakdarian on a tour to San Francisco, Orange County, Vancouver, Toronto, Boston and New York in the autumn of 2008, culminating in a concert at Carnegie Hall. Anne Manson was appointed Music Director and Principal Conductor of the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra in November, 2008, succeeding Roy Goodman in the post.</p>

				<p><strong>Anne Manson</strong></p>
				<p>Anne Manson, praised by <i>The New York Times</i> for conducting of &ldquo;balance, clarity and richness,&rdquo; is notable for her mastery of a wide range of opera and orchestral repertoire, from new works by living composers such as Philip Glass, Peter Maxwell Davies and John Harbison, to fresh interpretations of canonic works.</p>
				<p>Ms Manson currently serves as Music Director of the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra. She was the first woman to conduct at the Salzburg Festival, where she led Mussorgsky&rsquo;s <i>Boris Godunov</i> with the Vienna Philharmonic. She is one of only three women to have been appointed Music Director of a leading American symphony orchestra, having served as Music Director of the Kansas City Symphony from 1999 to 2003. She has guest conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the London Philharmonic, the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra and the Swedish Chamber Orchestra. She recently made her debut with the American Composers Orchestra at Carnegie Hall, a performance <i>The New York Times</i> described as &ldquo;outstanding,&rdquo; and she works regularly with orchestras throughout Spain. Recent and upcoming projects include Harbison&rsquo;s <i>The Great Gatsby</i> at the Aspen Music Festival; a program of Stravinsky, Tchaikovsky and Haydn at the Spoleto Festival; Philip Glass&rsquo;s <i>Galileo Galilei</i> and Puccini&rsquo;s <i>Madame Butterfly</i> with the Portland Opera; a production of Janacek&rsquo;s <i>Cunning Little Vixen</i> with Juilliard Opera; and Bizet&rsquo;s <i>Pearl Fishers</i> with Virginia Opera. The Washington National Opera&rsquo;s American Opera Initiative, which will premiere four new works in its 2012/13 inaugural season, recently named her one of three artistic mentors for the program, whose mission is to develop and showcase the talents of promising young opera composers.</p>
				<p><i>The New York Daily News</i> critic called Manson recent performance of Poulenc&rsquo;s <i>Dialogues des Carmelites</i> at The Juilliard School, &ldquo;one of the most thrilling musical experiences I&rsquo;ve ever had.&rdquo; Her first appearance with the New York City Opera, leading Samuel Barber&rsquo;s <i>Vanessa</i>, earned her the company&rsquo;s Richard F. Gold Debut Award. She also recently received Canada&rsquo;s DORA Award for outstanding musical direction for her work with the Canadian Opera Company on Benjamin Britten&rsquo;s <i>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>. Manson conducted Philip Glass&rsquo;s <i>Orph&eacute;e</i> with Portland Opera, and a subsequent recording of the work was chosen &lsquo;Critics&rsquo; Pick&rsquo; of the month by <i>Opera News</i>. Other opera projects include: Donizetti&rsquo;s <i>Maria Stuarda</i> and the US premiere of Jonathan Dove&rsquo;s <i>The Adventures of Pinocchio</i> at Minnesota Opera; Mozart&rsquo;s <i>Così fan tutte</i> at San Francisco Opera and Offenbach&rsquo;s <i>Orph&eacute;e aux Enfers</i> at Juilliard, which <i>The Financial Times</i> called &ldquo;an elegant achievement.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>As Music Director of Manitoba Chamber Orchestra (MCO), a post she assumed in 2008, she has led two hugely successful tours with world famous soprano Isabel Bayrakdarian and percussionist Dame Evelyn Glennie. In the next year the MCO will release two new recordings, one featuring orchestral works of Philip Glass and the other with Ms Bayrakdarian. Known for her exploration of new and unusual repertoire, Ms Manson has championed the work of living composers including Stewart Goodyear, Serge Arcuri, Michael Oesterle and Serouj Kradjian, and led the US premiere of Sir Peter Maxwell Davies&rsquo; <i>Kommilitonen</i>, an opera commissioned by Juilliard and the Royal Academy of Music.</p>
				<p>Ms Manson came to prominence early in her career as Music Director of London&rsquo;s Mecklenburgh Opera (1988–1996), where she programmed operas ranging from Mozart to 20th-century rarities and new commissions. Other major engagements have included the premiere of Scott Wheeler&rsquo;s <i>Democracy</i> (commissioned by Placido Domingo) for Washington National Opera, Carlisle Floyd&rsquo;s <i>Susanna</i> for Grand Theatre de Gen&egrave;ve, and Donizetti&rsquo;s <i>Viva la Mamma</i> for Stockholm Royal Opera.</p>

				<p><strong>Karl Stobbe</strong></p>
				<p>Described as an artist with &ldquo;soulful musicianship&rdquo; (<i>San Francisco Classical Voice</i>, 2008) and &ldquo;a remarkable artist who connects to his audience with laser-like focus&rdquo; (<i>Winnipeg Free Press</i>, 2003), Karl Stobbe has made a name for himself as one of Canada&rsquo;s most accomplished and diverse violinists. He regularly performs concerti, recitals, and chamber music, in addition to appearing frequently as a concertmaster in Canada and the US. In those roles, Karl has performed in Carnegie Hall, Jordan Hall, Segerstrom Hall, Roy Thomson Hall, the Orpheum Theatre, and many other important concert venues in North America. Karl is one of only a few people to perform as a soloist and chamber musician with Canada&rsquo;s National Arts Centre&rsquo;s Scene Festival in consecutive years, representing both the provinces of British Columbia and Manitoba as a featured artist. For his contribution to those events, he was invited to the Prime Minister&rsquo;s house for a reception celebrating the national music environment.</p>
				<p>Karl has collaborated as a soloist with many exceptional conductors, including Andrey Boreyko, Bramwell Tovey, Simon Streatfeild, Roy Goodman and Anne Manson.  In recital as a soloist and with the Clearwater String Quartet, Karl will complete performances of all of the Bach Unaccompanied Violin Sonatas and Partitas, all six Ysaÿe Unaccompanied Violin Sonatas, and all 16 Beethoven String Quartets in the next year. He is an avid performer of new music, playing and premiering many solo and chamber works by national and international composers. Karl has partnered with renowned violinist / fiddler Mark O&rsquo;Connor in giving the Canadian premiere of O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s Double Violin Concerto, as well as giving the world premieres as a soloist in works by Michael Oesterle, Doug Smith, and Jocelyn Morlock. As a member of the Clearwater String Quartet, he has premiered and performed compositions by almost every important living Canadian composer, including the world premiere of R. Murray Schafer&rsquo;s ninth quartet.</p>
				<p>A sought-after and dedicated teacher, Karl has maintained a private studio since the age of 18. He has conducted master classes throughout Canada and has taught at the universities of Manitoba and Brandon. His students have won many awards, completed advanced university music degrees and become fine musicians around the world. Karl has always loved woodworking, and completed a minor in Violin Repair and Construction while at Indiana University. He enjoys building new violins and has restored several older instruments. He appreciates the beautiful craftsmanship of the master luthiers as much as he enjoys playing their instruments.</p>
