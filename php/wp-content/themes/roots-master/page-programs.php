		<h4>Students love the excitement<br />of live chamber music!</h4>
		<p>Whether it&rsquo;s a school band or choir, Orff group, recorder ensemble, or private studio, children learn through music! There are so many reasons to bring the young people in your life to an MCO event &mdash; they won&rsquo;t hear anything like this anywhere else.</p>
		<p>Help them create a cultural and musical framework for themselves. Show them where their music studies can lead &mdash; they can become an audience member, composer, conductor, musician, board member, donor, educator or CD purchaser. Have fun sharing music with them and with other avid music fans.</p>
		<p><strong>School visits &mdash; the MCO comes to you</strong> / the MCO Outreach Ensemble is a roaming troupe of MCO players consisting of violin, viola, cello, double bass and guitar. It offers workshops and mini-concerts in schools throughout the province. Call 204.783.7377 for more info or to request a visit.</p>
