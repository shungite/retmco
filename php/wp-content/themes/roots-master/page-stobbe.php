		<p><strong>Karl Stobbe</strong> Described as an artist with &ldquo;soulful musicianship&rdquo; (<i>San Francisco Classical Voice</i>, 2008) and &ldquo;a remarkable artist who connects to his audience with laser-like focus&rdquo; (<i>Winnipeg Free Press</i>, 2003), Karl Stobbe has made a name for himself as one of Canada&rsquo;s most accomplished and diverse violinists. He regularly performs concerti, recitals, and chamber music, in addition to appearing frequently as a concertmaster in Canada and the US. A sought-after and dedicated teacher, Karl has maintained a private studio since the age of 18. He has conducted master classes throughout Canada and has taught at the universities of Manitoba and Brandon. His students have won many awards, completed advanced university music degrees and become fine musicians around the world. Karl has always loved woodworking, and completed a minor in Violin Repair and Construction while at Indiana University. He enjoys building new violins and has restored several older instruments. He appreciates the beautiful craftsmanship of the master luthiers as much as he enjoys playing their instruments.</p>
