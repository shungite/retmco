				Minstrel is a booking agency that brings central Canada&rsquo;s finest musicians to you. Whether you&rsquo;re looking to hire a flamenco guitarist for a wedding, a string quartet for a staff party or a full orchestra to back up a rock, hip hop, or jazz group &ndash; we do it all. Many of our artists have had illustrious careers as orchestral musicians, but our roster includes musicians of all styles and instrumental backgrounds. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Administered by the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra, Minstrel divides its work into three areas: 
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Accompaniment for other musicians</li>
				<li>Corporate functions, including receptions, conferences, and fundraisers</li>
				<li>Personal events, like weddings, birthdays, and home parties</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Under the first category, Minstrel has had collaborative engagements with Wayne Newton, Rod Stewart, Kanye West, Anne Murray, kd lang, and many other household names. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But don&rsquo;t let that fool you: our rates are competitive, and we work with our clients to determine the most efficient use of our musicians&rsquo; time to keep your costs low. Families, local bands, and small businesses hire us just as often as the stars do. And if you&rsquo;re looking to hire musicians to accompany you or an artist you represent, we have accomplished arrangers we work with who are experienced in preparing orchestral arrangements of music in all genres under tight deadlines.

				Under the second category, past clientele include but are not limited to:
