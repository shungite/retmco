      <b>
        LEO&#353; JAN&AACUTE;&#269;EK: STRING QUARTET NO. 2<br>&mdash;TRANSCRIBED FOR STRING ORCHESTRA BY MICHAEL OESTERLE 
      </b>
      </p>

      <p>
      Leo&#353; Jan&aacute;&#269;ek (1854-1928) composed his String Quartet No.2 in 1928 when he was around 74 years old. The string quartet was one of two string quartets commissioned by the Bohemian Quartet in 1923. Jan&aacute;&#269;ek subtitled String Quartet No. 1 &ldquo;after Tolstoy&rsquo;s Kreutzer sonata&rdquo; and further information about this work can be found in the Listening Guide for the February 18, 2015 Manitoba Chamber Orchestra concert. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Jan&aacute;&#269;ek also subtitled his second string quartet. He originally gave it the name &ldquo;Love Letters&rdquo; and then re-titled it &ldquo;Intimate Letters&rdquo; referring to hundreds of letters that Jan&aacute;&#269;ek wrote over many years, expressing his love to a young, married woman named Kamila St&ouml;sslov&aacute;. Jan&aacute;&#269;ek&rsquo;s wife Zdenka stated that St&ouml;sslov&aacute; was unimpressed with Jan&aacute;&#269;ek and although St&ouml;sslov&aacute; did not return Jan&aacute;&#269;ek&rsquo;s love and kept him at a distance for many years, the composer pursued St&ouml;sslov&aacute; obsessively and relentlessly for over a decade and she was the inspiration for several of Jan&aacute;&#269;ek&rsquo;s works, including the second String Quartet. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Jan&aacute;&#269;ek&rsquo;s letters to Kamila St&ouml;sslov&aacute; have been described as largely imaginative &mdash; his fantasized vision of what he hoped his relationship with Kamila could be. Jan&aacute;&#269;ek himself describes the relationship that inspires the string quartet as both real and imagined. In his letters to Kamila, Jan&aacute;&#269;ek calls the String Quartet No. 2 his &ldquo;first composition whose notes glow with all the dear things that we&rsquo;ve experienced together. You stand behind every note, you, living, forceful, loving &hellip; but everything&rsquo;s still only longed for &hellip;&rdquo; 
      </p>

      <p>
      Jan&aacute;&#269;ek described his second String Quartet as &ldquo;beautiful, strange, unrestrained, inspired, a composition beyond all the usual conventions&rdquo; (Arnold Whittall, 2003, p. 34).

      </div>

      <p>
      <b>
        The following music elements and questions can help you listen to this work:
      </b>
      </p>

      <span class="badge">1</span> <b>Form</b> in music refers to the musical architecture or the way the music is structured. Although this string quartet transcription is structured in four movements, you will not hear the kinds of traditional forms that classical composers commonly used for their string quartets. Instead, the four movements could be compared to scenes in an opera, each telling a different story about Jan&aacute;&#269;ek&rsquo;s feelings for Kamila St&ouml;sslov&aacute; as revealed through his letters to her. Sometimes the different scenes are challenging to distinguish however, as there is continuous development of various rhythmic and melodic fragments of sound. 

      Jan&aacute;&#269;ek begins each of his four movements with these tempo markings:
      <ol>
        <li>Andante (moderately slow, walking tempo)</li>
        <li>Adagio (slow)</li>
        <li> Moderato (moderate pace)</li>
        <li>Allegro (lively and quickly)</li>
      </ol>

      However, the movements are difficult to distinguish by tempo markings alone, as Jan&aacute;&#269;ek changes tempos many times during each movement, for example:

      <ol>
        <li>Andante &mdash; Con moto &ndash; Allegro</li>
        <li>Adagio &ndash; Vivace &ndash; Andante &ndash; Presto &ndash; Allegro &ndash; Vivo &mdash; Adagio</li>
        <li>Moderato &ndash; Adagio &mdash; Allegro</li>
        <li>Allegro &ndash; Andante &ndash; Con moto &ndash; Adagio &ndash; Tempo I</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
      The form used within each of the four movements also does not follow conventional kinds of musical structure and development although the fourth movement could be described as a kind of sonata/rondo form that features two contrasting and recurring thematic motifs. The first motif is heard at the opening of the fourth movement and the second motif takes the form of a leaping, trilled note melodic fragment. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Throughout the string quartet/transcription, themes are generally not presented in their entirety to be developed in predictable keys and ways as in Haydn or Mozart&rsquo;s time. Jan&aacute;&#269;ek may present a theme or theme fragment and then immediately interrupt its development with sudden exclamations of sound from other instruments. Can you hear this kind of treatment in the string quartet? What is the effect of this kind of musical structure? 
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">2</span> The original String Quartet was written for 2 violins, viola, and cello but the performance by the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra is a transcription for string orchestra by Michael Oesterle on commission from the MCO. What <b>instruments</b> can you hear in this transcription for string orchestra? How many performers are playing onstage? 
      </p>

      <p>
      Can you hear the highly charged conversations taking place between various instruments and sections of the orchestra that create feelings of intense emotional dialogue and quality? When do you hear individual instruments or sections and when do you hear the orchestra playing together? Which instruments are given the predominant motifs that are heard in this work?
      </p>

      <p>
      Can you pick out the viola in this work? The viola has a special and prominent role in this string quartet, as Jan&aacute;&#269;ek used this instrument to personify Kamila St&ouml;sslov&aacute;. Jan&aacute;&#269;ek originally intended this part to be played by the romantic viola d&rsquo;amore known as the viola of love. However, the soft tone quality of its sound didn&rsquo;t blend well with the other instruments of the string quartet, so Jan&aacute;&#269;ek replaced the viola d&rsquo;amore with the traditional viola. What can you find out about the viola d&rsquo;amore? 
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">3</span> Jan&aacute;&#269;ek uses <b>expressive elements</b> (musical elements that express certain feelings or dispositions) to capture his intense emotions and passion for Kamila St&ouml;sslov&aacute;. The composer uses rapidly changing <b>tempos</b> (the speed of the music) and <b>accelerando</b> (increases in tempo) to suggest agitation, anguish, passion, and varying emotions. Can you hear a particularly expressive accelerando in the third movement? This accelerando is so intense it creates an almost dizzying effect. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Does the string quartet/transcirption begin quickly or slowly? Can you hear when the music changes tempo? Can you hear when the tempo of the music changes and gets faster or slower in other sections of the string quartet transcription? How does that affect the mood of the work? Can you hear when Jan&aacute;&#269;ek repeats the same motif at different tempos?
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Dynamics</b> (the volume of the music) are also used to convey dramatic emotion, tension, and passionate feelings. When do you hear music or small motifs played loudly? Quietly? When do the dynamics change dramatically and what effect does that create? When does the music get suddenly louder (crescendo) or quieter (decrescendo)? Can you hear that the opening of this string quartet begins very loudly and then suddenly becomes very quiet just a short while later (bar 9)?
      </p>

      <p>
      Other expressive elements and special effects that create different moods throughout the work include sections marked <b>rubato</b> (expressive and rhythmic freedom) the use of <b>tremolo</b> (rapid back and forth movement of the bow on the same note) and <b>sul ponticello</b> (playing with the bow on or near the bridge). Can you hear the use of sul ponticello in the viola part in the opening of the first movement (bar 9)? Do you hear the use of tremolo in the viola and in other parts that creates frenzied, emotionally charged feelings?
      </p>

      <p>
      Jan&aacute;&#269;ek uses expressive effects in highly contrasting ways. Contrasts in tempo, dynamics, tone colour, and texture are dramatically juxtaposed, and there are frequent changes of tempo, texture, dynamics and tone colour. What effect and mood is created by these contrasts and changes? 
      </p>

      <p>
      Jan&aacute;&#269;ek stated that the first movement depicted the impression the composer had when he first saw Kamila; the second movement depicted his experience seeing Kamila over a year later; the third movement was intended to &ldquo;dissolve into a vision that resembles your [Kamila&rsquo;s] image;&rdquo; and the fourth movement was intended by Jan&aacute;&#269;ek to represent his great longing for Kamila and imagined fulfillment. How does the use of expressive elements help to create the contrasting and varying emotions that Jan&aacute;&#269;ek intended?
      </p>

      <P>
      <span class="badge">4</span> How is <b>rhythm</b> used in this string quartet transcription? Is this the kind of music that you can easily tap a steady rhythm or beat to? Can you hear that Jan&aacute;&#269;ek uses a very wide range and variety of rhythms that he repeats, contrasts and combines? Do you hear the way that Jan&aacute;&#269;ek uses rhythmic fragments to create the impression of speech patterns? Can you hear short rhythmic patterns (motifs) repeated at the opening of the work? Can you hear that the rhythmic pattern in the first four bars is repeated immediately and almost exactly in bars 5-8? 
      </P>

      <p>
      Do you hear the propelling rhythmic patterns rapidly repeated or repeated at different tempos to create feelings of great intensity? Can you hear an ostinato (a continually repeated melody or rhythm pattern) effect anywhere in this work? How are rhythms used to create a sense of drama and conflict in this work? Can you pick out dance sounding rhythms in the movement that begins Adagio?
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">5</span> How is <b>melody</b> or <b>pitch</b> used in this string quartet transcription?  
      </p>

      <p>
      Is this the kind of music that you can easily pick out a melody to hum or sing? Can you pick out short melodic motifs heard throughout the work? Can you hear the opening four bar melodic fragment repeated in bars 5-8? Can you pick out 3 different themes in the first movement? One theme, perhaps representing Jan&aacute;&#269;ek, is heard in the violins played over a trembling sound in the cellos; another theme is played by the sul ponticello viola representing Kamila; and a third leaping, arpeggio theme can be heard in the first violin. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Can you hear when these short melodic fragments are repeated, contrasted with each other, and combined in different ways throughout the movement? Can you hear when short motifs are rapidly repeated or repeated at changing tempos in this and other movements? Do you hear high sounds or pitches? Do you hear low sounds or pitches? Can you hear when the short motifs move higher or lower in pitch? Do you hear short melodic fragments played and traded by certain instruments or sections of instruments?  
      </p>

      <p>
      Can you hear two different themes played by the viola in the adagio movement? These themes are often considered to represent a love duet between Jan&aacute;&#269;ek and Kamila St&ouml;sslov&aacute;. Does the first melody played by the viola suggest sadness perhaps as a result of distance between Jan&aacute;&#269;ek and the woman he loves? Can you hear how this theme is transformed throughout the movement by different instruments and expressive treatment? Do you hear a sudden dance tune that might suggest an orchestra playing at the spa where Jan&aacute;&#269;ek and Kamila met in the setting suggested by this movement? What happens to the dance melody? Does it continue happily or do the sad sounding melodies of the opening movement return? What does this sad melodic ending suggest about the meaning of the second movement? 
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">6</span> What different kinds of <b>textures</b> do you hear in this work? Do you hear how Jan&aacute;&#269;ek uses the instruments to create a more minimalistic effect than the fuller orchestral sounds created in the Mozart Piano Concerto No. 26 also on this program? Jan&aacute;&#269;ek does not use traditional approaches to harmony or instrumental texture in this work but instead paints a mosaic of sound with various sound effects, tone colours, and melodic and rhythmic fragments, often interrupted by other instrumental sounds.   
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">7</span> What kinds of instrumental <b>timbre</b> do you hear? Timbre is the different qualities of sound that can be heard, for example the kinds of sounds that the string instruments make when they play together. When does the timbre of the music change because certain instruments are added or taken away? Can you hear different qualities of sound created by different instruments playing with the expressive techniques and effects such as <b>sul ponticello</b> described above? Can you hear the particular timbre of the viola (lower than the violin but higher than the cello) standing out over the other instruments at any time in this work?

      </p>

      <p><b>WOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART: PIANO CONCERTO NO. 26 IN D MAJOR (K 537) &ldquo;CORONATION&rdquo;</b></p>

      <p>
      Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) finished his second last piano concerto, the D major concerto No. 26 known as the &ldquo;Coronation&rdquo; concerto, in 1788. It was Mozart&rsquo;s publisher, rather than the composer himself who provided the subtitle for this piano concerto. The concerto was possibly titled &ldquo;Coronation&rdquo; as a marketing tool since Mozart performed the concerto around the same time or as part of festivities celebrating the Coronation of Leopold II in Frankfurt on October 15, 1790. 
      </p>

      <p>
      The Piano concerto No. 26 is unique among the 27 piano concertos that Mozart wrote. Mozart authorities hold very differing views of this work. It is criticized by some as not having the same quality as previous concertos and in fact as being regressive. However, other authorities view this concert as innovative and looking ahead to the romantic piano concerto, due to the profusion of virtuosic solo writing, stylistic experimentation and innovation, and the loose harmonic and rhythmic structure as compared to the earlier concertos. 
      </p>

      <p>
      The Piano Concerto No. 26 in D major was well received during Mozart&rsquo;s time and remains an enduring staple of the Mozart Piano concerto repertoire.

      </div>

      <p>
      <b>
        The following ideas and questions can help you listen to this work:
      </b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">1</span> <b>Form</b> in music refers to the musical architecture or the way the music is structured. Can you identify the form of this piano concerto? Can you hear that it is written in three different sections, or movements? They are called: 
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Allegro (fast and lively)</li>
        <li>Larghetto (a fairly slow tempo)</li>
        <li>Allegretto (fairly fast and lively but slower than allegro)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
      Each of the three sections or movements also has a particular form. The first movement Allegro is a variation of the typical classical symphonic form used for first movements known as sonata form. This sonata form variation is known by different names, such as concerto-ritornello form, or sonata form with double exposition. The sections of this first movement form are: 
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li><b>Exposition</b> (sometimes called ritornello or prelude) by the orchestra that states principal themes used in the concerto. Can you hear a first theme introduced by the orchestra that might sound appropriate for the coronation of Leopold II? Can you hear a second and contrasting legato, flowing theme?</li>
        <li><b>Exposition</b> by the solo piano. Can you hear where the piano begins by playing alone and can you hear the piano re-state the orchestra&rsquo;s opening theme? Can you hear where the piano has new virtuosic solo material not heard before?</li>
        <li><b>Development section</b> with orchestra and piano. Can you hear the orchestra and piano varying and combining some of the previously heard themes?</li>
        <li><b>Recapitulation</b> for orchestra and piano. Can you hear the re-statement of previous themes?</li>
        <li><b>Cadenza</b> for solo piano, a virtuosic, improvisatory section featuring the technical prowess of the pianist.</li>
        <li><b>Coda</b> or short concluding section for the orchestra.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
      Although Mozart titled the first movement &ldquo;Allegro,&rdquo; the second and third movements of this piano concerto were given these tempo markings and titles by music publishers. Can you hear the second slow movement &ldquo;Larghetto&rdquo; introduced by the piano? 
      </p>

      <p>
      Can you hear three different sections in this slow, second movement? Can you hear that a contrasting second section follows the first section? Can you hear sounds from the first section then repeated again? This kind of three-part form is known as ABA or ternary form. 
      </p>

      <p>
      The third Allegretto movement is called a sonata-rondo form. The rondo movement was a common form for the third movement in this time period. In rondo form, a main theme is repeated before and after contrasting sections. The repeated theme is called the A section. The contrasting sections are called B, C, D etc., depending on how many different sections the composer decides to compose. In this rondo the repeated theme is heard in three different episodes and can be described as an ABACBA form. 
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">2</span> What <b>Instruments</b> can you hear in this concerto? How many performers are playing onstage? Mozart wrote this concerto for solo piano, 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani (large drums) and strings. What string instruments do you hear (violin, viola, cello, double bass)? Can you pick out when you hear the other instruments? 
      </p>

      <p>
      Can you hear when the piano first plays? Do you hear the way that Mozart focuses on the piano and treats the piano as a special, solo instrument? Can you hear how Mozart gives the piano brilliant, virtuosic solo passages?
      </p>

      <p>
      Can you hear when the piano gets to play a very difficult, virtuosic, showy section all by itself towards the end of the first movement after the final return of the main themes? This showy section is called a cadenza.
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">3</span> Mozart uses <b>expressive elements</b> (music elements that express certain feelings or dispositions), <b>tempo</b> (the speed of the music), and <b>dynamics</b> (the volume of the music) to create different moods throughout the concerto. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Where do you hear music played quickly or slowly? Can you hear when the music changes tempo? Can you hear when the tempo of the music changes and gets faster or slower? How does that affect the mood of the work? Which movements use mostly fast music? Which movement uses mostly slow music?  
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Dynamics</b> (the volume of the music) are also used to provide tension and drama, and to create particular moods. Was the music played at all the same volume (dynamics)? When do you hear music played loudly? Quietly? When do the dynamics change and what effect does that create? When does the music get louder (crescendo) or get quieter (decrescendo)?  
      </p>

      <p>
      What dynamics are used at the beginning of each of the three movements? Can you identify the mood Mozart is trying to create in each movement? Can you hear a change in mood in the second, slow movement?
      </p>

      <p>
      Do you hear musical sounds that are short sounding (staccato) or very smooth sounding (legato)? Which movement or themes features legato sounds? Where do you hear suddenly loud sounds (accents)? 
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">4</span> How is <b>rhythm</b> used in this piano concerto? Do you hear sections that have a steady rhythm or beat that you could tap to? Did any particular rhythmic pattern stand out for you that you could listen for in the work? Was there a particular pattern that you could hear repeated anywhere in the work?  
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">5</span> How is <b>melody</b> or <b>pitch</b> used in this piano concerto?  
      </p>

      <p>
      Do you hear high sounds or pitches? Do you hear low sounds or pitches? Can you pick out a particular melody played by the orchestra instruments or piano in each of the three movements? Can you hum or sing that melody? Could you draw the shape of the melody in the air? When does it move up higher and when does it move lower?

      Can you hear when the piano plays rapidly ascending runs up the keyboard or descending runs down the keyboard? Can you hear when the piano plays trills (rapidly alternating notes) as part of the melodic line? Can you hear when stepwise melodies are contrasted with arpeggiated passages?

      <span class="badge">6</span> Can you hear different kinds of <b>texture</b> in this work? Where do you hear lots of instruments playing together so that the sound is thick? Where do you hear just a few instruments playing? Can you tell which instruments are playing? Where does the piano play all by itself?
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">7</span> What kinds of instrumental <b>timbre</b> do you hear? Timbre is the different qualities of sound that can be heard, for example the kinds of sounds that the string instruments make when they play together. When does the timbre of the music change because Mozart adds different instruments to the strings? Can you hear when the strings are playing alone and when they are playing together with the piano and other instruments?
