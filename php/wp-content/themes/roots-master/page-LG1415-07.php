      <p><b>WOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART: OVERTURE TO <I>DIE ZAUBERFL&Ouml;TE</I> (THE MAGIC FLUTE)</b></p>

      <p>
      Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) composed his 2 act comic opera Die Zauberfl&ouml;te (The Magic Flute) in 1791, the year he died. It premiered just three months before Mozart&rsquo;s death, was quickly embraced by audiences of the time, and has remained a hugely popular staple of the opera and orchestral repertoire around the world ever since. The Magic Flute was an innovative opera form called singspiel (similar to our Broadway musicals) that incorporated both singing and spoken dialogue. The opera combines comedy, farce, romance, fairy tale, Egyptian mythology, and Masonic elements. The opera features a Queen of the Night villain, her daughter Pamina, an Egyptian Prince named Tamino who rescues Pamina with the aid of a magic flute, Tamino&rsquo;s companion, a birdcatcher named Papageno, Papageno&rsquo;s romantic interest Papagena, and Sarastro, a High Priest of Isis and Osiris. 
      </p>
      <p>
      As was typical for the time, The Magic Flute opens with an instrumental overture. The approximately 5-7 minute overture that you will hear is an arrangement of Mozart&rsquo;s symphonic D major overture and is played by a wind octet of oboes, clarinets, bassoons, and horns.  
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>
        The following ideas and questions can help you listen to this work:
      </b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">1</span> <b>Form</b> in music refers to the musical architecture or the way the music is structured. The opera <i>The Magic Flute</i> is structured in 2 acts with an opening, introductory, instrumental <b>overture</b>. The <b>overture</b> played before the curtain opens sets the stage for the action and music to follow and helps the audience emotionally prepare for the opera. In Mozart&rsquo;s time the overture did not always contain reference to melodic themes heard in the rest of the opera but the slow introduction to this overture does contains three chords that are heard again in the opera at significant points. 
      </p>
      <p>
      The <b>form</b> of the <b>Overture</b> to <i>The Magic Flute</i> is the classic three section sonata form structure: a first section called <b>exposition</b> that presents 2 themes; a middle <b>development</b> section where the themes are varied and developed; and a final <b>recapitulation</b> section that re-states the main themes. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Can you hear the long, slow stately, introduction that Mozart uses to preface the exposition of the overture? This introduction foreshadows the priest&rsquo;s solemn processional and prayer to come later in the opera.
      </p>
      <p>
      After the slow introduction can you hear a fast (allegro) theme that begins quietly and then builds in intensity, suggesting the playful and light-hearted comedic aspects of the opera? Then can you hear a second, contrasting and complementary theme in a new key (B flat major) introduced by a series of ascending scales and played out as call and answer between the woodwinds? 
      </p>

      <p>
      Can you identify when the development section of this movement begins? There are musical clues that can help you. The beginning of the development is marked by variations of the three slow, solemn chords heard at the opening of the slow introduction to this overture.  After the slow, stately chords, listen to how Mozart develops the main themes in different ways and through various keys and modulations throughout the middle development section of this movement.  Can you hear when Mozart restates the main themes from the exposition with some variation in the recapitulation section at the end of the movement? 
      </p>

      <p>
      This kind of compositional development is characteristic of sonata form, which was typically used by Mozart for his later overtures.
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">2</span> What <b>Instruments</b> can you hear in this arrangement of Mozart&rsquo;s overture to <i>The Magic Flute</i>? Mozart originally scored this overture for: strings; two each of flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns and trumpets; three trombones; and timpani.  In this arrangement for wind octet can you hear two each of oboes, clarinets, bassoons, and horns? 
      </p>
      <p>
      Can you hear the wind instruments trading parts and calling and answering to each other throughout the overture? 
      </p>
      <p>
      <span class="badge">3</span> What <b>tempos</b> (the speed of the music) can you identify in this work? Can you hear a slow tempo at the beginning of the overture followed by an energetic Allegro (fast and lively)?  What <b>dynamics</b> (the volume of the music), and <b>expression</b> (musical elements that express certain feelings or dispositions) are used throughout this overture? Does the overture begin with loud or quiet dynamics?  
      </p>

      <p>
      What is the overall mood of this overture and how does Mozart achieve this mood?  Do you hear the contrasts between the serious, solemn mood at the beginning and middle of the overture and the light-hearted, playful qualities of the Allegro?  How does Mozart achieve this contrast of mood?  
      </p>

      <p>
      Was the music played at all the same volume (dynamics)?  When do you hear music played loudly? Quietly?  When do the dynamics change and what effect does that create?  When does the music get louder (crescendo) or get quieter (decrescendo)?  
      </p>

      <p>
      Do you hear musical sounds that are short sounding (staccato) or very smooth sounding (legato)?  Which movement features legato sounds? Where do you hear suddenly loud sounds (accents)? 
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">4</span> How is <b>rhythm</b> used in this overture? Do you hear sections that have a steady rhythm or beat that you could tap to? Did any particular rhythmic pattern stand out for you that you could listen for in the work?  Was there a particular pattern that you could hear repeated anywhere in the work?  
      </p>

      <p>
      Can you hear three different heavy, solemn chords that begin the slow introduction to the overture? The first chord is a long sound (half note) followed by a rest (no sound). Then a second chord is heard twice in a short long pattern followed by a rest. Finally a third chord is heard also heard twice in a short long pattern followed by a rest. 
      </p>

      <p>
      The number three has special significance in this overture and opera and is one of several Masonic references that various musicologists have identified in this work. Mozart was a member of the order of Masons and Masonic influences and ideas may be heard in his later works. The number three has mystical properties for the order of Masons and references to that ritualistic number abound in The Magic Flute, for example the three chords at the beginning of the overture, the three temples, ladies, and boys in the opera, and the three flats in the key signature (E flat major).  
      </p>
      <p>
      Some analysts have compared the sounds of the opening three chords of the overture to the sounds of Masonic candidates who knock three times at the door in Masonic initiation ceremonies. However, there is nothing in Mozart&rsquo;s writings or correspondence that either confirm or deny this possibility. Whether or not they are Masonic references, these sounds certainly create a feeling of importance and create a serious beginning and sense of anticipation for this opera. Can you hear the repeated 3 chords from the beginning of the overture anywhere else in this opening work (listen around the middle of the overture just before the development section)?
      </p>
      <p>
      After the slow introduction, the first theme contains a repeated pattern. Pat a beat and say the words &ldquo;running, running, running everyone is running, running, running, everyone is running, etc,&rdquo; and be sure to say the words &ldquo;everyone is&rdquo; twice as fast as you say the words &ldquo;running.&rdquo; As you pat four steady beats you should be able to say &ldquo;running&rdquo; to each of the first three beats and then say &ldquo;everyone is&rdquo; while you pat the fourth beat. Can you find the sounds of those words in the overture and traded back and forth between instruments?  
      </p>
      <p>
      The second theme is a contrasting rhythmic pattern that sounds like &ldquo;don&rsquo;t make me have to run so fast don&rsquo;t make me have to run so fast&rdquo; also traded between the instruments.  Where can you hear this rhythmic pattern?
      </p>
      <p>
      Can you hear any other repeated rhythmic patterns in the overture?
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">5</span> How is <b>melody</b> or <b>pitch</b> used in this overture?  
      </p>

      <p>
      Do you hear high sounds or pitches?  Do you hear low sounds or pitches? Can you pick out a particular melody played by certain woodwind instruments? Can you hum or sing that melody? Could you draw the shape of the melody in the air?  When does it move up higher and when does it move lower?  
      </p>

      <p>
      Can you hear that each of the opening three chords are played higher than the previous chord?  Can you hear the repeated notes in the &ldquo;running running running&rdquo; pattern of the first theme?  The same note is heard 6 times in a row before it moves up and down on the &ldquo;everyone is&rdquo; part of the rhythmic pattern. Can you hear the same pattern played at a higher register?
      </p>

      <p>
      Can you hear these repeated notes traded back and forth between instruments?  Can you hear parts of the melody introduced in one instrument (called voice) and then imitated at different pitches and heard in other voices or instruments?  This is called contrapuntal writing and is used in a musical form called a <b>fugue</b>.  Mozart uses fugal writing in this overture when the theme is interwoven between parts so that the same short melody or phrase is imitated by different voices or instruments or heard coming at different points by different instruments. The word fugue comes from the Latin word fuga meaning chase or flight.  Can you hear how different voices or instruments chase or run from each other? 
      </p>

      <p>
      Can you hear that the second theme is not made up of repeated notes but instead, is a melody that includes ascending and descending scale like passages?
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">6</span> Can you hear different kinds of <b>texture</b> in this work?  Where do you hear all the instruments playing together so that the sound is thick? (Think of the opening chords of the overture).  The three slow opening chords of the overture introduce the key of the piece and consist of the main tonic chord (I), subdominant (IV), and dominant (V), chords of the key of E flat major.  They are referred to elsewhere in the opera, particularly related to the temple and Sarastro, the High Priest.
      </p>

      <p>
      Where do you hear a thinner texture where just a few instruments playing or taking turns?  Can you tell which instruments are playing?
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">7</span> What kinds of instrumental <b>timbre</b> do you hear? <b>Timbre</b> is the different qualities of sound that can be heard. For example, the timbre of the oboe is different to the timbre of the clarinet, bassoon, or horn.  Can you pick out each of those instruments when they are playing just by listening to their individual timbres?

        WOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART: OVERTURE TO DON GIOVANNI
      </b>
      </p>
      <p>
      Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) composed his 2 act opera <i>Don Giovanni</i> in 1787. It was an immediate success with audiences and remains one of the most popular operas of all time. Mozart called <i>Don Giovanni</i> an opera buffa (comic opera) although it was billed as a &ldquo;drama giocoso&rdquo; to indicate that it contained elements of both drama and comedy.  The opera features a character named Don Giovanni, a licentious Spanish nobleman with a reputation for seducing and abusing women. The opera chronicles Don Giovanni&rsquo;s exploits of attempted rape, murder, and deceit, his relations with the characters Donna Anna, Donna Elvira, and Zerlina, and his eventual downfall.  
      </p>
      <p>
      In the first scene of the opera, Don Giovanni kills Donna Anna&rsquo;s father, Don Pedro, the Commendatore and in the final scene of the opera, a marble statue of the Commendatore comes to life to punish Don Giovanni, ushering him into hell.  
      </p>
      <p>
      As was typical for the time, <i>Don Giovanni</i> opens with an instrumental overture. Mozart famously composed the overture the night before the opera&rsquo;s premiere. The approximately 6-7 minute overture that you will hear is an arrangement of Mozart&rsquo;s symphonic overture and is played by a wind octet of oboes, clarinets, bassoons, and horns.  
      </p>
      <p>
      You can find out more about Mozart by viewing Haley Rempel&rsquo;s comments on the MCO website: http://www.themco.ca/concert/manson-barnatan/

      <p>
      <b>
        The following ideas and questions can help you listen to this work:
      </b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">1</span> <b>Form</b> in music refers to the musical architecture or the way the music is structured. The opera <i>Don Giovanni</i> is structured in 2 acts with an opening, introductory, instrumental <b>overture</b>. The <b>overture</b> played before the curtain opens sets the stage for the action and music to follow and helps the audience emotionally prepare for the opera. In Mozart&rsquo;s time the overture did not always contain reference to melodic themes heard in the rest of the opera but in this overture, the Commendatore&rsquo;s theme is heard in the opening introduction to the overture. Other musical elements in the overture are also heard again at different points of the opera.  
      </p>
      <p>
      The <b>form</b> of the <b>Overture</b> to <i>Don Giovanni</i> is the classic three section sonata form structure. The first section is called an <b>exposition</b> that typically presents 2 themes; however, in this particular overture you will hear 3 distinct themes in the exposition, none of which are borrowed from the opera. A middle <b>development</b> section follows where the themes are varied and developed, and a final <b>recapitulation</b> section re-states the main themes.
      </p>
      <p>
      The sounds of the overture portray the contrasting moods of the <i>drama giocoso</i>. Can you hear the slow dramatic introduction that Mozart uses to preface the exposition of the overture? The ominous, foreboding opening chords of the introduction set the stage for the opera&rsquo;s dark, tragic, dramatic elements which are in strong contrast with the following energetic giocoso allegro which some listeners believe are meant to portray the character of Don Giovanni. The contrast between the opening foreboding sounds and the following lively allegro underline the qualities of the <i>drama giocoso</i> and the opposition between drama and comedy.
      </p>

      <p>
      The overture importantly foreshadows the dramatic action involving the Commendatore as it introduces different motifs associated with the Commendatore in Act Two. The opening fearsome D minor chord of the overture has been called the &lsquo;Don Giovanni&rsquo; chord since it is heard later in the opera associated with the Don Giovanni character as his statue comes to life.
      </p>

      <p>
      Listen for the long slow sounds of the opening chords, then a silence that some listeners call deathly, then sounds in the same rhythmic pattern but sounding four notes lower. Then can you hear repeated notes and a long short long short long rhythmic pattern?  Following that you will hear a short ascending pattern alternating with two lower sounding notes. These imposing and sinister sounds are heard again when the Commendatore appears in the dining room at the end of the opera.
      </p>

      <p>
      Then can you hear a series of sinister sounding up and down scale passages followed by music that changes character and becomes much more lively and impetuous?  This lively music contains the first theme of the exposition. The second theme begins with contrasts between a loud long chord followed immediately with light quiet but playful fast descending staccato scales, again suggesting contrasts between the dramatic and comedic characters. You can identify the beginning of the third theme by a long note followed by four descending notes played loud and staccato (short, separated, detached notes) followed by a quick light, repeated note passage played more quietly.  
      </p>

      <p>
      After a short rest, the development section mainly features the third theme of the exposition, which makes it challenging to distinguish between the development section and the end of the exposition. However the recapitulation is much easier to identify. Can you hear all three themes repeated in the recapitulation section?
      </p>

      <p>
      This kind of compositional development is characteristic of sonata form, which was typically used by Mozart for his later overtures.
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">2</span> What <b>Instruments</b> can you hear in this arrangement of Mozart&rsquo;s overture to <i>Don Giovanni</i>? Mozart originally scored this overture for: strings; two each of flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns and trumpets; three trombones; and timpani.  In this arrangement for wind octet can you hear two each of oboes, clarinets, bassoons, and horns?
      </p>
      <p>
      Can you distinguish between the different instruments of the octet playing the different themes and rhythms of the overture? Can you hear the different instruments taking turns on various parts or calling back and forth to each other?
      </p>
      <p>
      <span class="badge">3</span> What <b>tempos</b> (the speed of the music) can you identify in this work? Can you hear a slow tempo at the beginning of the overture followed by an energetic Allegro (fast and lively)?  How are <b>dynamics</b> (the volume of the music), and <b>expression</b> (musical elements that express certain feelings or dispositions) used to convey the contrasting nature of the <i>drama giocoso</i>? Can you hear the opening chords associated with the Commendatore played loudly and strongly and the quieter, more playful sections that suggest the playful and comedic aspects of the opera? Can you hear other contrasts of loud and quieter music?
      </p>

      <p>
      When do the dynamics change and what effect does that create?  When does the music get louder (crescendo) or get quieter (decrescendo)?  
      </p>

      <p>
      Do you hear musical sounds that are short sounding (staccato) or very smooth sounding (legato)?  What effect do these sounds create? Can you hear suddenly loud sounds (accents)? What kinds of contrasting characters or moods do these dynamic and expressive effects suggest? 
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">4</span> How is <b>rhythm</b> used in this overture? Do you hear sections that have a steady rhythm or beat that you could tap to? Did any particular rhythmic pattern stand out for you that you could listen for in the work?  Was there a particular pattern that you could hear repeated anywhere in the work?  
      </p>

      <p>
      Do you hear silences (rest) between the opening chords of the overture?  Do you hear the long short long short rhythmic pattern that follows?  This pattern is repeated over and over again; a repeated note pattern is called an <b>ostinato</b>. Do you hear other repeated note rhythmic patterns in the overture?  Can you hear different rhythmic patterns repeated in the overture?
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">5</span> How is <b>melody</b> or <b>pitch</b> used in this overture?  
      </p>

      <p>
      Do you hear high sounds or pitches?  Do you hear low sounds or pitches? Can you pick out a particular melody played by certain woodwind instruments? Can you hum or sing that melody? Could you draw the shape of the melody in the air?  When does it move up higher and when does it move lower?  
      </p>

      <p>
      Can you hear that after the first rest at the beginning of the overture, the melody of the next chords is four notes lower then the opening chords? Can you hear the repeated note melody in the next long short long short pattern? Can you hear that the choice of melodic notes used in the up and down scalic passages of the slow introduction create a menacing sound?
      </p>

      <p>
      In the main theme of the exposition can you hear repeated melodic notes? In the second theme can you hear descending melodic passages that might sound like someone tip toeing down the stairs?  In the third theme can you hear a short low descending scale fragment that might sound like very heavy feet stomping five times?  Then can you hear a much higher melody contrasting melody with repeated notes?  
      </p>

      <p>
      Can you hear this third theme varied in the development?  Can you hear the melodies in the three themes return again in the recapitulation?
      </p>

      <p>

        WOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART: OVERTURE TO <i>THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO</i> (LE NOZZE DI FIGARO)
      </b>
      </p>
      <p>
      Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) composed his 4 act opera <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i> (Le nozze di Figaro) in 1786. The Marriage of Figaro is known as an <b>opera buffa</b> (comic opera) based on a stage comedy of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
      The opera&rsquo;s premiere was a notable success and <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i> remains one of the most performed operas of all time. You may have heard part of this overture used in different films, for example the movie Trading Places. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i> is set in Spain, in the castle of Count Almaviva. The Count&rsquo;s valet and former barber, Figaro is to marry Susanna, the Countess&rsquo;s maid. However, the Count is planning to seduce Susanna, while the Countess is pursued by Cherubino, a young Page.  The opera features a tangled web of comedy, romance, misadventure, and mistaken identity as the relationships and action of the opera unfold. 
      </p>
      <p>
      As was typical for the time, <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i> opens with an instrumental overture. Mozart famously composed the overture just a few hours before the opera&rsquo;s premiere. The approximately 4-5 minute overture that you will hear is an arrangement of Mozart&rsquo;s symphonic overture and is played by a wind octet of oboes, clarinets, bassoons, and horns.  
      </p>
      <p>
      You can find out more about Mozart by viewing Haley Rempel&rsquo;s comments on the MCO website: http://www.themco.ca/concert/manson-barnatan/

      <p>
      <b>
        The following ideas and questions can help you listen to this work:
      </b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">1</span> <b>Form</b> in music refers to the musical architecture or the way the music is structured. The opera <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i> is structured in 4 acts with an opening, introductory, instrumental <b>overture</b>. The <b>overture</b> played before the curtain opens sets the stage for the action and music to follow and helps the audience emotionally prepare for the opera. In Mozart&rsquo;s time the overture did not always contain reference to melodic themes heard in the rest of the opera although Mozart&rsquo;s late operas did often include themes heard in the opera.  However, <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i> is a stand-alone work and does not contain any thematic references found in the rest of the opera, although the character of the music does suggest the frenetic action and qualities of the characters in the opera. 
      </p>
      <p>
      The <b>form</b> of the <b>Overture</b> to <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i> is an abridged sonata form structure. The three section sonata form that Mozart uses for the overture to <i>The Magic Flute</i> and <i>Don Giovanni</i> is shortened here to just two main sections. A smaller, shorter sonata is often called a <b>sonatina</b>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      The first section is called an <b>exposition</b> that typically presents 2 themes.  In sonata form, a middle <b>development</b> section typically follows where the themes are varied and developed, but there is no development section in this overture. A final <b>recapitulation</b> section re-states the main themes, followed by an extended <b>coda</b> (conclusion) to balance the structure since there is no development section.  
      </p>
      <p>
      Unlike the overtures to <i>The Magic Flute</i> and <i>Don Giovanni</i> which both feature a slow introduction, the overture to <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i> launches immediately into the first theme of the overture, a whispered <b>pianissimo</b> (very quiet), very fast and agitated passage, suggesting perhaps, the conspiratorial whispers and intrigue to come. The hectic <b>presto</b> (very fast) tempo marking of the overture conveys the frenetic, breathless pace and buoyant mood of the opera as a whole. 
      </p>

      <p>
      The second part of the first theme begins with a long note followed by an <b>arpeggio</b> pattern (notes of a chord sounding a fast succession). Other thematic fragments are then introduced as part of this first multi-theme group, and about halfway through the exposition, you will hear a contrasting second multi-theme group that can be identified by a more static melody, the sound of sudden, loud accents, and quick <b>ornaments</b> (notes added to decorate or embellish the main melodic notes).  Can you hear that all the themes or theme fragments are mostly introduced quietly which adds to the feeling of intrigue and secrecy? The effervescent themes then bubble up throughout the overture creating a feeling of wit, anticipation, and buoyant good humour. 
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">2</span> What <b>Instruments</b> can you hear in this arrangement of Mozart&rsquo;s overture to <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i>? Mozart originally scored this overture for: strings; two each of flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns, trumpets; and timpani.  In this arrangement for wind octet can you hear two each of oboes, clarinets, bassoons, and horns?
      </p>
      <p>
      Can you distinguish the different instruments of the octet playing the different themes and rhythms of the overture? Can you hear the different instruments taking turns on various parts or calling back and forth to each other?
      </p>
      <p>
      <span class="badge">3</span> What is the overall <b>tempo</b> (the speed of the music) of this work? Can you hear how the Presto tempo always seems to be moving forward at a breathless pace to set up the frenetic mood of the opera action to follow?
      </p>

      <p>
      How are <b>dynamics</b> (the volume of the music), and <b>expression</b> (musical elements that express certain feelings or dispositions) used to convey the sense of intrigue and the qualities of comic opera?  Do you hear sudden accents, contrasts between loud and quiet, and long-drawn out crescendos that create an exciting sense of anticipation? Can you hear a very long, extended, controlled crescendo at the end of this overture?  How does this crescendo add to the sense of building tension? This kind of crescendo is called a <b>Mannheim crescendo</b>. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Do you hear any unexpected dynamic changes? The dynamic surprises hint at surprises in the action of the opera. Can you hear the many contrasts between loud and quiet in this overture? How might the sudden changes in dynamics or the contrasts between loud and quiet, fast and slow, also suggest different characters in the opera? 
      </p>

      <p>
      Do you hear musical sounds that are short sounding (staccato) or very smooth sounding (legato)?  What effect do these sounds create, especially when they are contrasted against each other?  
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">4</span> How is <b>rhythm</b> used in this overture? Do you hear the steady pulsing, and persistent rhythms throughout this work? Do any particular rhythmic patterns stand out for you that you could listen for in the work? Is there a particular pattern that you could hear repeated anywhere in the work?  Do you hear running patterns of notes throughout this overture?
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">5</span> How is <b>melody</b> or <b>pitch</b> used in this overture?  
      </p>

      <p>
      This overture abounds in various catchy melodies and melodic fragments. Can you pick out any particular melody or part of a melody? Can you hum or sing any? Could you draw the shape of any melody in the air? Can you hear the rising melodies that create a feeling of buoyancy and energy?  Can you hear the quickly ascending and descending scalic melodies? Can you hear where Mozart uses high, middle, and low notes? How does Mozart use melody to create both a sense of mystery and a sense of playfulness?
      </p>

      <p>
      Mozart is a brilliant master of writing melody and some consider Mozart to be one of the greatest melody writers ever. The overture to <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i> certainly highlights Mozart&rsquo;s genius for writing melodies. There are no less than 9 distinct fast-paced melodic themes or theme fragments found in this overture.  Some of the melodic ideas or themes are introduced only to be quickly abandoned or interrupted as Mozart introduces yet another, different melodic theme just a few beats or bars later. However, all 9 or more melodic themes and thematic fragments can be grouped into two main multi-part theme groups that are contrasting in style as described above in the section on form. 
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">6</span> How would you describe the <b>texture</b> of this work?  Do you hear the instruments all playing together at once to create thick sounding chords or do you hear the different voices of the instruments interacting together in more linear ways?   
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">7</span> What kinds of instrumental <b>timbre</b> do you hear? <b>Timbre</b> is the different qualities of sound that can be heard. For example, the timbre of the oboe is different to the timbre of the clarinet, bassoon, or horn.  Can you pick out each of those instruments when they are playing just by listening to their individual timbres?

        EUG&Egrave;NE YSA&Yuml;E: SONATA IN E MAJOR, OP. 27, NO. 6
      </b>
      </p>
      Beryl Peters, Ph.D.

      <p>
      Eug&egrave;ne Ysa&yuml;e (1858-1931), was one of the most renowned violin virtuosos of his time. He was also a highly regarded teacher, conductor and composer. Ysa&yuml;e was born in Belgium but was an important part of musical communities around the world. Many composers associated with C&eacute;sar Franck&rsquo;s circle of composers wrote and dedicated works to Ysa&yuml;e, for example Saint-Saens, d&rsquo;Indy, Debussy, and Franck. Ysa&yuml;e was a founder-member of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.
      </p>
      <p>
      Ysa&yuml;e composed the sixth in a set of six sonatas for unaccompanied solo violin in 1923. Ysa&yuml;e composed each of the six sonatas in Op. 27 to reflect a different character, style, and personality associated with famous contemporaries of his time. The sonatas were also conceived as Ysa&yuml;e&rsquo;s response to his fascination with the music of J. S. Bach, in particular J.S. Bach&rsquo;s Six Unaccompanied Violin Sonatas and Partitas.The sixth sonata was an homage to the great Spanish violinist Manuel Quiroga and has less Bach influences than the other sonatas of Op. 27. 
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>
        When you listen to this Violin Sonata by Ysa&yuml;e, you will hear a work that incorporates the Spanish habanera.

      <p>
      <b>
        The following questions can help you listen to this work.
      </b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">1</span> <b>Form</b> in music refers to the musical architecture or the way the music is structured. This work for solo violin was composed as a single movement structure. The form can be described as a free rhapsody that includes a <b>cadenza</b> (a showy, difficult, virtuosic section) introduction and various contrasting sections.  Can you hear a section that sounds very lyrical with Spanish influences?  It occurs just after the opening cadenza.  Can you hear a section with very demanding and complex technical passages?  Can you hear a section that sounds like a tango?  
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">2</span> What <b>Instruments</b> do you hear playing this work? Is the violin playing by itself or do you hear any other instruments accompanying the violin?  Ysa&yuml;e specifically wrote all six of the sonatas in Op. 27 to be unaccompanied violin sonatas. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <span class="badge">3</span> What <b>tempo</b> (the speed of the music) would you mainly associate with this work?  The composer marked this work as &ldquo;Allegro giusto non troppo vivo&rdquo; meaning lively and quickly with consistent speed but not too fast. 
      </p>

      <p>
      What <b>dynamics</b> (the volume of the music), and <b>expression</b> (musical elements that express certain feelings or dispositions) are used throughout this sonata? Can you hear where the composer creates the effect of rubato (expressive and rhythmic freedom)? 
      </p>

      <p>
      Was the music played at all the same volume (dynamics)?  When do you hear music played loudly? Quietly?  When do the dynamics change and what effect does that create?  When does the music get louder (crescendo) or get quieter (decrescendo)?  
      </p>

      <p>
      Do you hear musical sounds that are short sounding (staccato) or very smooth sounding (legato)? Can you hear a section where there are sudden accents (sforzandos) on every other up bow? 
      </p>

      <p>
      Ysa&yuml;e uses expressive elements to capture the character of Spanish music, including the tango and haberna rhythm. Ysa&yuml;e also uses expressive elements and special effects to create different rich textures throughout the work. These effects include highly demanding virtuoso bow and left hand techniques such as slurred and fast double stops, broken octaves, descending chromatic thirds, arpeggiated chords, difficult string crossing passages, grace notes, trills, jazz-like harmonies, difficult scale passages, and chromatic playing, etc. 
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">4</span> How is <b>rhythm</b> used in this sonata? Is this the kind of music that you could keep a steady rhythm or beat to? Or do the rhythms have a more rhapsodic, virtuoso and improvisatory quality?
      </p>

      <p>
      Can you hear a brief silence that Ysa&yuml;e marks as a &ldquo;grand pause&rdquo; in the music about halfway through the approximately 7 minute sonata? 
      </p>

      <p>
      Do you hear the habanera rhythm of the tango following the grand pause?  Listen for a rhythm that sounds &ldquo;long short even&rdquo; with an accent occurring on the &ldquo;e&rdquo; of even—the upbeat in the middle of the bar.  If you have ever heard Bizet&rsquo;s opera <i>Carmen</i> you will remember the famous habanera rhythm in that work.  Do you hear other syncopated (off beat) sounds in the tango section and in the sonata? 
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">5</span> How is <b>melody</b> or <b>pitch</b> used in this sonata?  
      </p>

      <p>
      Do you hear high sounds or pitches?  Do you hear low sounds or pitches? Can you pick out a particular melody to hum from this sonata or do the melodies have a more rhapsodic, fantasy-like and improvisatory quality to them?
      </p>

      <p>
      Do the melodies seem to belong clearly to one key or do you hear dissonances and chromatic notes?
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">6</span> Can you hear different kinds of <b>texture</b> in this work?  Do you hear places where the violin plays single notes and other places where two notes are played together?  Do you hear places where more than 2 notes are played together to create a thicker texture?  
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">7</span> What kinds of <b>timbre</b> do you hear? <b>Timbre</b> is the different qualities of sound that can be heard, for example when the composer create special effects using techniques described above.  Can you hear different qualities of sound created by the different virtuosic techniques?

        LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN: OCTET IN E FLAT MAJOR, OP. 103
      </b>
      </p>
      <p>
      Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) composed his Octet in E flat major Op. 103 between 1792 and 1793.  This octet is from Beethoven&rsquo;s early period, about the time he was studying with Haydn. Haydn and Mozart influences can be heard in this work. 
      </p>
      <p>
      The Octet in E flat major was composed for the Elector Maximilian Franz of Cologne as entertaining dinner music.  Beethoven then re-composed the Octet as his String Quartet No. 4 in 1796.

      <b>
        The following questions can help you listen to this work:
      </b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">1</span> Form in music refers to the musical architecture or the way the music is structured. The form of the Octet in E flat major is typical for classical string quartets and symphonies, although the treatment of the menuetto as more like that of a scherzo was certainly forward looking. The Octet in E flat major is structured in four movements:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Allegro (fast and lively)</li>
        <li>Andante (moderately slowly, walking pace);</li>
        <li>Menuetto and Trio (A minuet, in this case, more like a scherzo which is also in &frac34; time but more lively and playful in nature than a minuet); 
          IV. Presto (very fast)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
      Each of the four sections or movements also has a particular form.  The first movement Allegro is written in sonata form.  Sonata form is made up of three sections: a first section called <b>exposition</b> that presents 2 themes; a middle <b>development</b> section where the themes are varied and developed; and a final <b>recapitulation</b> section that re-states the main themes. 
      </p>

      <p>
      The first and second themes are not highly contrasting but can be distinguished by instrumentation. Can you hear the lively theme 1 in the oboe part and a second theme stated in the bassoon and clarinet sections? 
      </p>

      <p>
      Can you hear how Beethoven explores many ways to vary these themes in the development section?  And can you hear a new motive played by the clarinet in this section? Can you hear how all the instruments restate the two main themes in the recapitulation section? 
      </p>

      <p>
      The Andante movement is in a song-form or ABA structure where the first and second parts of the movement are the same or similar, and the middle part is a contrasting section. Can you hear the beautiful main theme expressed first in the oboe part? This andante could also be described as a duet.  Can you hear the main theme sung between the oboe and bassoon to create the effect of an operatic duet between soprano and baritone? 
      </p>

      <p>
      The form of the Minuetto and Trio is also an ABA structure.  However, this particular minute was innovative for its time, since it is one of Beethoven&rsquo;s first scherzos.  The scherzo is more lively and playful than the stately ¾ minuet court dance.  Can you hear the dynamic contrasts of the scherzo? In the middle trio can you hear a dialogue between the clarinet and horns?  
      </p>

      <p>
      The Presto finale is a rousing finish to this octet. It takes the form of a rondo-sonata. In rondo form, a main theme is repeated before and after contrasting sections.  The repeated theme is called the A section.  The contrasting sections are called B, C, D etc., depending on how many different sections the composer decides to compose. Sonata form features the statement, development and re-statement of two main themes. In this Presto, what does the main theme sound like to you?  Does it have fanfare qualities? Can you hear the constant variations of the main theme throughout the Presto?  Does the second theme remind you of any other melody—perhaps Beethoven&rsquo;s <i>Hymn of Joy</i>? Can you hear a coda or conclusion that features virtuosic writing for the horns? Can you hear special improvisatory parts for the oboe and clarinet? 
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">2</span> The Octet is written for 2 each of oboes, clarinets, bassoons, and horns. Can you distinguish between these instruments as you hear them playing? Listen for the oboe playing the first theme in the opening Allegro.  Can you hear the oboe&rsquo;s theme passed all around the different instruments of the ensemble?   Can you hear the oboe playing a soloistic part at the beginning of the second movement and the answering duet by the bassoon? Can you hear the instruments trading melodies back and forth? When do you hear individual instruments or sections and when do you hear the octet playing together? What other instruments are given predominant motifs heard in this work?
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">3</span> Beethoven uses <b>expressive elements</b> (musical elements that express certain feelings or dispositions), varying <b>tempos</b> (the speed of the music), and <b>Dynamics</b> (the volume of the music) to create interest.  Which movements use louder music?  Which movements use quieter music?  Which movements are faster or slower than others? Which movement has the fastest tempo of all? 
      </p>

      <p>
      When do the dynamics change dramatically and what effect does that create?  When does the music get suddenly louder (crescendo) or quieter (decrescendo)?  
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">4</span> How is <b>rhythm</b> used in this octet?  Are the rhythms lively or stately?  Which movement could you easily tap a steady rhythm or beat to? The rhythmic treatment in this octet mostly follows the traditions of the time. Did any particular rhythmic pattern stand out for you anywhere that you could listen for in the work?  Was there a particular pattern that you could hear repeated anywhere in the work?  Can you hear how the rhythm of the oboe theme in the first movement is repeated throughout that entire movement? Did you hear any instances of syncopation (accent on off beat) in the first movement and in the final Presto movement?  Did you hear a repeated rhythmic pattern in the bassoon part in the first movement?  This is called an <b>Alberti bass</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
      How are beats grouped in each movement?  Can you hear how the beats are grouped in twos (count 1,2,1,2,1,2) in the first movement and grouped in threes (count 1,2,3,1,2,3) in the second movement?  
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">5</span> How is <b>melody</b> or <b>pitch</b> used in this octet?  Do you hear high sounds or pitches?  Do you hear low sounds or pitches? Can you pick out a particular melody in each of the four movements?  Can you hum or sing that melody? Could you draw the shape of the melody in the air?  When does it move up higher and when does it move lower?  
      </p>

      <p>
      Do you hear a melody in a certain instrument that is then played by a different instrument?  This is characteristic of music of this time. How does the shape of the melody played by the oboe in the first and second movements differ?
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">6</span> What different kinds of <b>textures</b> do you hear in this work?  Do you hear how Beethoven uses traditional approaches to harmony and instrumental texture in this work? Listen for how Beethoven creates the effect of steady accompaniment in the lower parts as for example the Alberti and arpeggiated bass parts in the bassoon in the first movement, while the higher instruments play the melodies above. The harmonies in this work heard usually in lower instruments function to support and accompany melodies often heard in the higher sounding instruments. 
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">7</span> What kinds of instrumental <b>timbre</b> do you hear? <b>Timbre</b> is the different qualities of sound that can be heard, for example the kinds of sounds played by different instruments.  What is the difference between an oboe and a horn in terms of timbre?  When does the timbre of the music change because certain instruments are added or taken away? Can you hear different qualities of sound created by different instruments when instruments call and respond to each other? 
      </p>

      <p>
      Can you hear a full, rich sound in the first chord at the outset of the octet created by all the instruments playing together followed by a lighter sound and contrasting timbre as the oboe and clarinets play together? Can you hear where Beethoven creates new timbre or tone color by layering instruments in or out, and by altering low and high instrument ranges? 
      </p>

      <p>
      Can you hear the contrast in characteristic timbre and color between the clarinet and horns in the trio section of the octet in the third movement? Can you hear how the final movement features instruments in soloistic ways and also combines all the instrumental timbres to create a weave of colour? 
      </p>

      <p>
      Listen for how often Beethoven give the soprano line to the oboe, the alto part to the clarinet, the tenor to the horns, and the bass part to the bassoons throughout the octet.

      <b>ANTONIN DVO&#345;&Aacute;K: SEXTET IN A MAJOR, OP. 48</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      Antonin Dvo&#345;&aacute;k (1841-1904) composed the Sextet in A major, Op. 48 in 1878. It was premiered as a private performance at the home of the renowned violinist Joseph Joachim. This marked the first time that Dvo&#345;&aacute;k&rsquo;s work had been heard outside of Bohemia (now Czechoslovakia), his home. The work was extremely well received and was the first of his compositions to enjoy international success.  
      </p>
      <p>
      The sextet was written during a period of composition that is known as Dvo&#345;&aacute;k&rsquo;s Slavic period. During this time, Dvo&#345;&aacute;k&rsquo;s writing featured Slavic folk elements which can be heard throughout the four movements of the Sextet.

      <p>
      <b> The following questions can help you listen to this work: </b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">1</span> <b>Form</b> in music refers to the musical architecture or the way the music is structured. Can you hear that the Sextet in A major is structured in four movements?  They are: 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Allegro moderato (moderately lively and quickly).</li>
        <li>Dumka. Poco allegretto (A Dumka folk song played slightly moderately fast).</li>
        <li>Furiant. Presto (An extremely fast Bohemian dance).</li>
        <li>Finale. Tema con variazioni. Allegretto grazioso, quasi andantino (Theme and Variations, fairly fast and gracefully, almost at an andantino tempo).</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
      Each of the four sections or movements also has a particular form. The form of the Allegro moderato first movement of the Sextet is the classic <b>sonata form</b> structure that contains: a first section called <b>exposition</b> that presents the main themes (in this example, 3 distinct theme groups can be heard); a middle <b>development</b> section where the themes are varied and developed; and a final <b>recapitulation</b> section that re-states the main themes. 
      </p>
      <p>
      The first theme is presented right at the beginning of the first movement. Can you hear a quiet, gentle theme marked at the outset by repeated notes?  The second theme can be identified by a melodic leap followed by an off-beat three note rhythmic figure that creates an accent on beat 4, next followed by four notes walking upwards and then turning downwards for two notes.  A short closing theme occurs at a section marked molto tranquillo (very calmly) that contains two long notes followed by a descending scale passage. 
      </p>

      <p>
      In the development section where Dvo&#345;&aacute;k develops the main melodies, can you hear the three note off-beat rhythmic pattern of the second theme throughout this section? 
      </p>

      <p>
      Can you hear the main themes return again in the recapitulation section? Can you hear how the second theme is varied and moves through many different tonalities so that it sounds like another development section contained within the recapitulation?
      </p>

      <p>
      Dvo&#345;&aacute;k used a ballad type folk song form called &ldquo;Dumka&rdquo; for his second movement.  Dvo&#345;&aacute;k used this song-form in other compositions he wrote and generally the dumkas featured contrasts between melancholy themes and more joyous ones. In this work you will hear that the opening main subject or theme is melancholy.  Can you hear that the second theme, identified by contrasting Hungarian melodic sounds, is still a melancholy theme?
      </p>

      <p>
      The third movement is marked &ldquo;Furiant&rdquo;. A Furiant is a very fast and fiery Bohemian/Czech folk dance with shifting accents and alternating between 2/4 and 3/4 time. However this particular version of &ldquo;Furiant&rdquo; does not feature the alternating 2 and 3 beat rhythms and it also lacks a fiery nature. Can you hear that the structure of this movement is an A B A scherzo and trio form where the outer sections are the same or similar and the middle section is a contrasting one? 
      </p>

      <p>
      The fourth movement takes the form of a theme and variations.  After the theme is stated in the opening of the fourth movement, can you hear how it is varied throughout this movement?  Dvo&#345;&aacute;k numbers the different variations in the music &mdash; can you hear how many different variations of the main theme Dvo&#345;&aacute;k composed for this movement? 
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">2</span> The Sextet Op. 48 was written for 2 violins, 2 violas, and 2 cellos. Can you distinguish between these instruments as you hear them playing? Can you hear the instruments trading melodies back and forth? This style of music featuring independent melodic lines relating with each other is called <b>contrapuntal</b>. When do you hear individual instruments or sections and when do you hear the sextet all playing together? What instruments are given predominant motifs heard in this work?
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">3</span> Dvo&#345;&aacute;k uses <b>expressive elements</b> (musical elements that express certain feelings or dispositions), varying tempos (the speed of the music), and <b>Dynamics</b> (the volume of the music) to create interest.  Which movements use louder music?  Which movements use quieter music?  
      </p>

      <p>
      When do the dynamics change dramatically and what effect does that create?  When does the music get suddenly louder (crescendo) or quieter (decrescendo), for example, in the Furiant?  Also in the Furiant can you hear loud accents that contrast with very quiet sections?  How does that affect the mood of the work?
      </p>

      <p>
      Which movements are faster or slower in tempo than others? Which movement has the fastest tempo of all? Can you hear contrasting fast and slow tempos in the Dumka second movement?
      </p>

      <p>
      Can you hear contrasts between staccato (short sounds) and legato sections (flowing, connected sounds)? Can you hear places where the players pluck the strings (pizzicato)? 
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">4</span> How is <b>rhythm</b> used in this Sextet? Many of the rhythms of Bohemian/Czech folk dances and songs are heard in this work and there is considerable rhythmic variation.  Do you hear dotted note patterns (long then short sounds)?  Do you hear off beat rhythms that create the effect of an accent on beat four?  Can you pick out the three note off-beat rhythmic pattern of the second theme heard throughout the development section of the first movement?  Do you hear even rhythmic patterns?  Uneven long short long short patterns?
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">5</span> How is <b>melody</b> or <b>pitch</b> used in this Sextet?  Many of the wealth of melodies featured in this work are taken from Bohemian or Czech folk tunes &mdash; can you hear those qualities in the melodies in this work? Dvo&#345;&aacute;k is known for his beautiful melodies. Can you pick out parts of these melodies that can be easily sung or hummed? 
      </p>

      <p>
      Can you hear melodies and melody fragments repeated and combined in different ways? Do you hear high sounds or pitches?  Do you hear low sounds or pitches? Can you hear when the melody notes are repeated or moving up or down in scale like patterns?  Can you hear when melody notes jump higher or lower in pitch? 
      </p>

      <p>
      Examples of different melodic treatment can be heard in the three themes. The first four melodic notes of theme 1 following an initial upbeat note are repeated.  By contrast, the first two notes of the second theme are a leap of a fifth.  The second theme continues with other leaps and then in the development section these leaps become even larger &mdash; can you hear large 8 notes melodic leaps?  An 8 note interval is called an octave.  The first two long notes of the third theme are a rising skip apart (an interval of a third) followed by a descending scale pattern ending in a leap down. 
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">6</span> What different kinds of <b>textures</b> do you hear in this work?  Do you hear how Dvo&#345;&aacute;k creates rich sonorities with the instruments of the sextet?  By adding a second viola and cello to the traditional string quartet configuration, Dvo&#345;&aacute;k created rich tone colours and colourful harmonies, borrowing from sounds found in Slavic dances and folk-songs. 
      </p>

      <p>
      <span class="badge">7</span> What kinds of instrumental <b>timbre</b> do you hear? <b>Timbre</b> is the different qualities of sound that can be heard, for example the kinds of sounds that the string instruments make when they play together.  When does the timbre of the music change because certain instruments are added or taken away?  How is the timbre of this work where all the instruments are string instruments contrast to timbres in the Beethoven octet where the instruments are oboes, clarinets, bassoons, and horns?
