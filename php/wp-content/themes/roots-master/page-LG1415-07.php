      <p>&nbsp;<br><b>Listening Guide for Bloch, From Jewish Life: Prayer; Janacek String Quartet No. 1; Haydn Cello Concerto in D Major, Op. 101</b><br>Beryl Peters, Ph.D.</p>

      <p><b>ERNEST BLOCH: FROM JEWISH LIFE: PRAYER</b></p>

      <p>Ernest Bloch (1880-1959) composed <i>From Jewish Life</i> around 1924. Bloch originally composed this moving triptych for cello and piano; it has since been arranged using various instrumentation by different arrangers. The work is made up of three pieces or movements: Prayer, Supplication, and Jewish Song, all dedicated to cellist Hans Kindler. Bloch wrote that his intent was not to reconstruct authentic Jewish music or melodies, but to capture the complex, ardent Jewish spirit and soul.</p>

      <p><b>When you listen to <i>Prayer</i> by Ernest Bloch, you will hear the opening movement from the work “From Jewish Life” arranged for chamber orchestra. The first movement “Prayer” is reflective, emotionally intense, and expressive.</b></p>

      <p><b>The following questions can help you listen to this work:</b></p>

      <p><span class="badge">1</span> <b> Form</b> in music refers to the musical architecture or the way the music is structured. <i>From Jewish Life</i> is made up of three pieces or movements:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Prayer (Andante moderato)</li>
        <li>Supplication (Allegro non troppo)</li>
        <li>Jewish Song (Moderato)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>At the concert on March 17, 2015, you will hear the first movement of <i>From Jewish Life</i> titled <i>Prayer</i>. <i>Prayer</i> can be considered a version of variation form in which the initial main theme is recurring and then contrasted with another theme. As you listen to <i>Prayer</i> can you pick out the recurring first theme and a second contrasting theme?</p>

      <p><span class="badge">2</span> This arrangement of <i>Prayer</i> is for solo cello and chamber orchestra. At the opening of this work what <b>instruments</b> do you hear? Can you hear the solo cello featured right from the beginning of the work? Can you hear the rising opening theme in the solo cello part echoed by the violins?</p>

      <p>When do you hear individual instruments or sections and when do you hear the orchestra playing together? Which instruments are given the predominant motifs that are heard in this work?</p>

      <p><span class="badge">3</span> Bloch uses <b>expressive elements</b> (musical elements that express certain feelings or dispositions) to convey emotional intensity, sadness, and a reflective quality. Do you hear how the slow <b>tempo</b> (the speed of the music) helps to create a somber, reflective and introspective mood?</p>

      <p>How are <b>dynamics</b> (the volume of the music) used to create emotional intensity and an introspective, prayerful quality? Is there a wide range of dynamics used in this piece or a narrow range of dynamics? Do you hear sudden, dramatic changes in dynamics or are there more subtle changes in dynamics? What level of dynamics is mostly used in this piece?</p>

      <p><span class="badge">4</span> How is <b>rhythm</b> used to create a sense of <i>Prayer</i>? Is this the kind of music that you can easily tap a steady rhythm or beat to—is there a strong sense of pulse and time? Can you hear strong accents in this music? Or are the rhythmic patterns free and exploratory? Are rhythmic and melodic patterns more <b>legato</b> (smooth, even, flowing, and connected)? How does this contribute to the reflective, introspective nature of this work?</p>

      <p>Can you hear different rhythmic treatment between the two contrasting themes? Do you hear a flowing rhythmic pattern in the opening theme and a repeated note rhythmic pattern in the second, contrasting theme? Do you hear any repetition of rhythmic fragments or motifs? How do the contrasting themes and motif repetition affect the emotional quality of this work?</p>

      <p><span class="badge">5</span> How is <b>melody or pitch</b> used in <i>Prayer</i>? Can you sing or hum the opening theme played in the cello? Can you hear that this opening rising, stepwise theme has different sound qualities than a major scale? Can you hear the influences of Jewish melodies and prayer modes in the melodies and motifs of this piece? Can you hear unusual, exotic sounds created by the use of modes and intervals of augmented seconds? The Jewish liturgical mode <i>Ahava Raba</i> is featured in the final, concluding section or <b>coda</b> of this piece.</p>

      <p>Do you hear short, recurring melodic phrases (<b>leitmotif</b>)? Can you hear the voice of a synagogue cantor in the sounds and repetition of motifs and melodic phrases?</p>

      <p>Can you hear how short melodic and rhythmic motifs are transformed when they are played by different instruments, when they are repeated, and when motifs in heard in sequences and variations?</p>

      <p>Can you hear two different main melodic themes in this piece? The second theme can be identified by its contrasting nature and sounds. Can you hear a repeated note pattern in the second main theme? When do you hear high sounds or pitches? When do you hear low sounds or pitches? Can you hear a phrase where the cello plays from a very high range down to a lower range? What kind of emotional quality do the higher pitches create? What kind of emotional quality do the lower pitches create in this work?</p>

      <p><span class="badge">6</span> What different kinds of <b>textures</b> do you hear in this work? Do you hear the fuller orchestral sound and defined harmonies of Haydn’s Cello Concerto in D major? Or do you hear more impressionist harmonies and textures? Impressionist music is characterized by vague tonalities and an indefinite quality to harmonies. Do you hear atmospheric sounds? Do you hear colour, movement, and suggestion of impressionist harmonies in this work?</p>

      <p><span class="badge">7</span> What kinds of instrumental <b>timbre</b> do you hear? <b>Timbre</b> is the different qualities of sound that can be heard, for example the kinds of sounds that the string instruments make when they play together. When does the timbre of the music change because certain instruments are added or taken away? Can you hear how different instrumental timbre is used to transform melodic phrases and motifs?

      <p><b>LEO&Scaron; JAN&Aacute;&Ccaron;EK: STRING QUARTET NO. 1</b><br>(arr. Michael Oesterle)</p>

      <p>Leo&scaron; Jan&aacute;&ccaron;ek (1854-1928) composed his String Quartet No.1 in 1923 when he was around 69 years old. The string quartet was a commissioned work subtitled &ldquo;after Tolstoy&rsquo;s &lsquo;Kreutzer sonata.&rsquo;&rdquo; The String Quartet was inspired by Leo Tolstoy&rsquo;s tragic novella, <i>Kreutzer Sonata</i> which recounts the disturbing and dark story of a man who murders his wife, a pianist, whom he suspects of having an affair with a violinist. Tolstoy titled his novella after Beethoven&rsquo;s violin sonata No.9, dedicated to Rudolph Kreutzer, a renowned violinist of the time. The wife and supposed lover play Beethoven’s sonata together at a key moment in the story. The String Quartet No. 1 has been called a wordless opera because of the way that the unfolding music captures the intense dialogue, emotions, and turmoil of the characters in Tolstoy&rsquo;s novella. The Manitoba Chamber Orchestra program notes for this work contain more details about this story.</p>

      </div>

      <p><b>When you listen to this transcription of the String Quartet No. 1 by Jan&aacute;&ccaron;ek, you will hear a highly unique four movement work that captures the emotional and psychological circumstances expressed in Tolstoy&rsquo;s novella <i>Kreutzer Sonata</i>. You will hear Jan&aacute;&ccaron;ek use motifs, rhythms, tempos, and instrumentation in innovative, varied and expressive ways to create a sense of conflict and tragedy and intensely emotional and turbulent speech-like dialogue.</b></p>

      <p><b>The following questions can help you listen to this work:</b></p>

      <p><span class="badge">1</span> <b>Form</b> in music refers to the musical architecture or the way the music is structured. Although this string quartet transcription is structured in four movements, you will not hear traditional forms such as sonata or rondo form that Haydn uses in the Cello Concerto in D major also on this program. Although Jan&aacute;ček titles his work in four movements, the work is one of continuous development of various rhythmic and melodic fragments of sound.</p>

      <p>Can you hear the way that changes in tempo help to distinguish the four movements below:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Adagio, Con moto (slowly, with motion)</li>
        <li>Con moto (with motion)</li>
        <li>Con moto, Vivace, Andante, Tempo I (with motion, fast and lively, moderately slowly—walking pace; tempo 1)</li>
        <li>Con moto (with motion)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The form used within each of the four movements also does not follow conventional kinds of musical structure and development. Themes are not presented in their entirety to be developed in predictable keys and ways as in Haydn&rsquo;s time. Jan&aacute;&ccaron;ek sometimes presents a theme or theme fragment only to interrupt its development with sudden exclamations of sound from other instruments. Can you hear this kind of treatment at the opening of each of the first three movements? What is the effect of this kind of musical structure?</p>

      <p><span class="badge">2</span> The original String Quartet was written for 2 violins, viola, and cello. What instruments can you hear in this transcription for string orchestra? How many performers are playing onstage?</p>

      <p>Can you hear the highly charged conversations that take place between various instruments and sections of the orchestra to create a feeling of intense emotional dialogue and conflict? For example, listen to dialogue between first violins and cellos at the beginning of the third movement. When do you hear individual instruments or sections and when do you hear the orchestra playing together? Which instruments are given the predominant motifs heard in this work?</p>

      <p><span class="badge">3</span> Jan&aacute;&ccaron;ek uses expressive elements (musical elements that express certain feelings or dispositions) to capture the dark, disturbing emotional extremes and tension expressed in Tolstoy’s novel and in the characters. The composer uses rapidly changing tempos (the speed of the music) and accelerando (increases in tempo) to suggest restless, changing energy and actions and varying emotions.</p>

      <p>Does the string quartet begin quickly or slowly? Can you hear when the music suddenly changes tempo after only a couple of bars? Can you hear when the tempo of the music changes and gets faster or slower in other sections of the string quartet transcription? Do you hear the dramatic accelerando effects in the second Con Moto movement? Can you hear when Jan&aacute;&ccaron;ek repeats the same motif at different tempos? How do the changing tempos affect the mood of the work? Various sources have identified more than 50 changes of tempo in this work!</p>

      <p>Dynamics (the volume of the music) are also used to create expressive effects. When do you hear music or small motifs played loudly? Quietly? When do the dynamics change dramatically and what effect does that create? When does the music get suddenly louder (crescendo) or quieter (decrescendo)?</p>

      <p>Other expressive elements and special effects that create different moods throughout the work include the use of tremolo (rapid back and forth movement of the bow on the same note), sul ponticello (playing with the bow on or near the bridge), pizzicato (using the fingers to pluck the strings), muted strings (fitting a small device called a mute on the stringed instrument to alter and mute the sound of the instrument) and harmonics (overtones that are high in pitch). Can you hear the use of tremolo and sul ponticello in the second Con Moto movement? Do you hear the use of a tremolo and pizzicato that creates a frenzied, emotionally charged mood in the final, fourth movement?</p>

      <p>In a letter to a friend, Jan&aacute;&ccaron;ek wrote that &ldquo;I was imagining a poor woman, tormented and battered to death by her husband, just like the one the Russian writer Tolstoy describes in his Kreutzer Sonata.&ldquo; What expressive elements help to create a sense of torment and despair in the music?</p>

      <p><span class="badge">4</span> How is rhythm used in this string quartet transcription? Is this the kind of music that you can easily tap a steady rhythm or beat to? Can you hear that Jan&aacute;ček uses a very wide range and variety of rhythms that he repeats, contrasts and combines? Do you hear the way that Jan&aacute;&ccaron;ek uses rhythmic fragments to create the impression of speech patterns? Can you hear short rhythmic patterns (motifs) repeated at the opening of the work? Do you hear the propelling rhythmic patterns rapidly repeated or repeated at different tempos to create feelings of great intensity? Can you hear the use of ostinato (a continuously repeated melody or rhythmic pattern) anywhere in this work? How are rhythms used to create a sense of drama and conflict in this work? Can you pick out a polka sounding rhythm in the second Con Moto movement?</p>

      <p><span class="badge">5</span> How is melody or pitch used in this string quartet transcription? Is this the kind of music that you can easily pick out a melody to hum or sing? Can your ear pick out short melodic motifs heard throughout the work? Can you hear when these short melodic fragments are repeated, contrasted with each other, and combined in different ways? Do you hear short melodies repeated using an ostinato effect? Can you hear these short motifs rapidly repeated or repeated at changing tempos? Do you hear high sounds or pitches? Do you hear low sounds or pitches? Can you hear when the short motifs move higher or lower in pitch?</p>

      <p>Do you hear the rising quality of the opening melodic motif of this work that seems to suggest the beginning narration of Tolstoy’s story? Can you pick out this theme again at the beginning of the fourth movement in the low strings? Do you hear short melodic fragments played and traded by certain instruments or sections of instruments?</p>

      <p>If you have ever heard Beethoven&rsquo;s Kreutzer Violin sonata, you might recognize, as some listeners do, fragments of a theme from the first movement of this sonata in the third movement of Jan&aacute;&ccaron;ek&rsquo;s String Quartet. Some listeners identify the violin sonata&rsquo;s first movement, slow, lyric second theme at the beginning of Jan&aacute;&ccaron;ek&rsquo;s String Quartet third movement (bar 8). The supposed Beethoven theme is distorted and repeated with increasing intensity to suggest tension and conflict, perhaps on the part of the husband in Tolstoy&rsquo;s novella.</p>

      <p>Jan&aacute;&ccaron;ek marks a melodic fragment in the fourth movement and played by the first violin "like in tears". How does Jan&aacute;ček use melody and expressive elements to create the feeling of tears at the close of this work?</p>

      <p><span class="badge">6</span> What different kinds of textures do you hear in this work? Do you hear how Jan&aacute;&ccaron;ek uses the instruments to create a minimalistic effect rather than the fuller orchestral sound created in Haydn’s Cello Concerto in D major that is also on this program? Jan&aacute;&ccaron;ek does not use traditional approaches to harmony or instrumental texture in this work but instead paints a mosaic of sound with various sound effects, instrumental colours, melodic and rhythmic fragments, and interruptions of sounds.</p>

      <p><span class="badge">7</span> What kinds of instrumental timbre do you hear? Timbre refers to different qualities of sound, for example the kinds of sounds that the string instruments make when they play together. When does the timbre of the music change because certain instruments are added or taken away? Can you hear different qualities of sound created by different instruments playing with the expressive techniques and effects such as sul ponticello described above?</p>

      <p><b>FRANZ JOSEPH HAYDN: CELLO CONCERTO IN D MAJOR, OP. 101</b></p>

      <p>Franz Joseph Haydn (1732-1809) composed his second Cello Concerto in D major around the year 1783 although it was at one time attributed to Anton Kraft, a renowned cellist whom Haydn knew well. Anton Kraft studied composition for awhile with Haydn and aslo premiered the work, but musicologists are now convinced that the work was written by Haydn. Haydn likely composed the work for Kraft as soloist since Kraft was such a prominent cellist of the time. A manuscript in Haydn’s writing of this cello concerto, rediscovered in the twentieth century, further confirms the authenticity of this Haydn work which is one of only two authenticated cello concertos by Haydn.</p>

      <p>Haydn may have learned much about composing for cello from Anton Kraft; certainly this famous virtuosic cello concerto has been delighting audiences since it was first composed and performed well over 200 years ago!</p>

      <p><b>When you listen to this Cello Concerto by Haydn, you will hear a work in three different sections called movements. You will hear a solo cello perform in virtuosic ways.</b></p>

      </div>

      <p><b>The following questions can help you listen to this work:</b></p>

      <p><span class="badge">1</span> Can you hear that this concerto is written in three different sections, or movements? They are called:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Allegro moderato (moderately fast and lively)</li>
        <li>Adagio (slowly)</li>
        <li>Allegro (fast and lively)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Each of the three sections or movements also has a particular form. The first movement Allegro moderato is written in sonata form. Can you hear the orchestra introduce the two main themes of this movement in the opening introduction (called ritornello)? Can you hear those two different themes then played by the solo cello?</p>

      <p>Can you hear how Haydn develops the two lyrical principal and secondary themes introduced at the beginning of the work in different ways throughout this movement, and then returns to the themes at the end of the movement? This kind of compositional development is characteristic of sonata form.</p>

      <p>If you have ever heard Mozart&rsquo;s opera Don Giovanni, listen to see if you can hear the similarity between one of the opera’s arias and the opening theme of the first movement!</p>

      <p>The second Adagio slow movement in A major is organized in five parts in a way similar to sonata-form. The different sections are all connected by the solo singing melody of the cello throughout.</p>

      <p>At the beginning of the slow movement, can you hear a beautiful melodic theme played by the cello accompanied by a few stringed instruments? Can you hear this main theme returning throughout the movement? Can you hear how the music played between the statements of the main theme contains variations or decorations of the theme? Is there one section that has a different mood to the others?</p>

      <p>Can you hear any similarities between the opening Adagio theme and the opening first movement Allegro theme?</p>

      <p>Do you hear the return of the main theme at the end of the Adagio with a final short cadenza played by the cello?</p>

      <p>The third Allegro movement is called a rondo. The rondo movement was a common form for the third movement in this time period. In rondo form, a main theme is repeated before and after contrasting sections. The repeated theme is called the A section. The contrasting sections are called B, C, D etc., depending on how many different sections the composer decides to compose. In this rondo the repeated theme is heard in three different episodes.</p>

      <p>Do you hear how the folk-like motif first heard in the cello is used to build the rest of the movement?</p>

      <p><span class="badge">2</span> What <b>instruments</b> can you hear in this concerto? How many performers are playing onstage? What string instruments do you hear (violin, viola, cello, double bass)? Can you pick out when you hear the oboes and horns? Can you hear a harpsichord playing? </p>

      <p>When do you first hear the cello? Do you hear the way that Haydn focuses on the cello and treats the cello as a special, solo instrument? Can you hear how Haydn gives the cello brilliant solo passages that feature the cello’s upper register in the opening movement?</p>

      <p>Can you hear when the cello gets to play a very difficult, virtuosic section all by itself towards the end of the first movement after the final return of the main themes? This showy section is called a <b>cadenza</b>.</p>

      <p>Can you hear when the orchestra plays by itself or when different instruments can be heard above the rest? Which instruments are given the predominant melodies or themes in this work?</p>

      <p><span class="badge">3</span> Although this concerto does not have the dramatic tension and contrast that can sometimes be heard in Haydn’s works, the composer does use <b>tempo</b> (the speed of the music), <b>dynamics</b> (the volume of the music), and <b>expression</b> (musical elements that express certain feelings or dispositions) to create different moods throughout the concerto.</p>

      <p>Can you identify the mood Haydn is trying to create in each movement? Can you hear a change in mood when Haydn writes a section of the second movement Adagio in a minor key?</p>

      <p>Haydn was known for the good humour that can be heard in some of his writing. Can you hear that cheerful, good humour in the final Allegro movement? Can you hear where Haydn gives the cello soloist opportunities to demonstrate virtuosic technique?</p>

      <p>Which movements use mostly fast music? Which movement uses mostly slow music? Can you hear when the tempo of the music changes and gets faster or slower? How does that affect the mood of the work?</p>

      <p>Was the music played at all the same volume (dynamics)? When do you hear music played loudly? Quietly? When do the dynamics change and what effect does that create? When does the music get louder (crescendo) or get quieter (decrescendo)?</p>

      <p>Do you hear musical sounds that are short sounding (staccato) or very smooth sounding (legato)? Which movement features legato sounds? Where do you hear suddenly loud sounds (accents)?</p>

      <p><span class="badge">4</span> How is <b>rhythm</b> used in this cello concerto? Do you hear sections that have a steady rhythm or beat that you could tap to? Did any particular rhythmic pattern stand out for you that you could listen for in the work? Was there a particular pattern that you could hear repeated anywhere in the work?</p>

      <p>The opening movement begins with a gentle rhythmic pattern that sounds like “Who’s knocking knocking please--come in.” Do you hear that pattern in the first movement? Can you hear the “knocking knocking” rhythm motif in the second theme of the first movement?</p>

      <p>Part of the first movement theme 1 rhythmic pattern is heard again in the opening of the second movement Adagio—can you hear the little “please—come in” motif in the cello?</p>

      <p>Can you hear any other repeated rhythmic patterns in other movements? Did any particular rhythmic pattern stand out for you that you could listen for in this symphony?</p>

      <p><span class="badge">5</span> How is <b>melody or pitch</b> used in this cello concerto?</p>

      <p>Do you hear high sounds or pitches? Do you hear low sounds or pitches? Can you pick out a particular melody played by the orchestra instruments or cello in each of the three movements? Can you hum or sing that melody? Could you draw the shape of the melody in the air? When does it move up higher and when does it move lower?</p>

      <p>Can you hear that the opening melody (theme) in the first movement is pitched in a high register and the second melody (theme) is pitched in a lower register? Do you hear a melody in a certain instrument that is then played by a different instrument?</p>

      <p>Can you hear a melody that is repeated over and over again in the third section or movement of the cello concerto? A piece where a melody keeps coming back after different or contrasting sections is called a rondo.</p>

      <p><span class="badge">6</span> Can you hear different kinds of <b>texture</b> in this work? Where do you hear lots of instruments playing together so that the sound is thick? Where do you hear just a few instruments playing? Can you tell which instruments are playing?</p>

      <p><span class="badge">7</span> What kinds of instrumental <b>timbre</b> do you hear? Timbre is the different qualities of sound that can be heard, for example the kinds of sounds that the string instruments make when they play together. When does the timbre of the music change because Haydn adds different instruments to the strings? Can you hear when the strings are playing alone and when they are playing together with the cello and other instruments?</p>

      <p>Can you hear different qualities of sound when the oboes, horns, and harpsichord play with the cello and orchestra?</p>
