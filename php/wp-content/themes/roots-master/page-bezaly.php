		<p><strong>Sharon Bezaly</strong> Described by <i>The Times</i> as &ldquo;God&rsquo;s gift to the flute,&rdquo; Sharon Bezaly was chosen &lsquo;Instru­ment­al­ist of the Year&rsquo; by <i>Klassik Echo</i> in Ger­many in 2002 and &rsquo;Young Artist of the Year&lsquo; at the Cannes Clas­sical Awards in 2003. <i>Clas­sics Today</i> hailed her as &ldquo;a flut­ist vir­tu­ally without peer in the world today&rdquo; and <i>Inter­na­tional Record Review</i> stated &ldquo;Her record­ings and con­cert appear­ances are typ­ic­ally more than simply tri­umphs: they are defin­ing artistic events.&rdquo; Bezaly gave her debut con­cert as a soloist with the Israel Phil­har­monic Orches­tra con­duc­ted by Zubin Mehta when she was 14. She then stud­ied at the Con­ser­vatoire national superieur de musique in Paris under Alain Marion, Ray­mond Guiot and Maurice Bourge, win­ning the Academy&rsquo;s first prizes for flute and cham­ber music. Sub­sequently, she was invited by Sandor Vegh to play as prin­cipal flaut­ist in his Cam­erata Aca­dem­ica Salzburg, a pos­i­tion she held until his death in 1997. Sharon Bezaly plays a 24-carat gold flute, spe­cially built for her by the Muramatsu team, Japan.</p>
