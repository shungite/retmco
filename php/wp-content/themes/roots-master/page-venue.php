				While the MCO presents many concerts throughout Manitoba, across Canada and abroad, the Orchestra&rsquo;s usual home is in historic Westminster United Church, located at 745 Westminster at Maryland in Winnipeg. With some of the richest acoustics of any venue in the city, Westminster&rsquo;s intimate sanctuary means that every audience member feels like they have the best seat in the house to see some of the world&rsquo;s greatest musicians.

					<b>Where can I collect my tickets?</b>

					<b>I&rsquo;m a subscriber. How do I exchange tickets?</b> 
				</p>
				<p>
					For subscribers, any concert ticket is good at any other show in the same season. All we ask is that you inform us at least 48 hours in advance of concert day that you would like to swap that ticket for another. This allows us to know how many seats we have available for sold out shows. Simply call 204-783-7377 at least two days before the concert. For obvious reasons, we are unable to exchange tickets into a sold-out concert.

					<b>I can’t make it to an upcoming MCO concert. Can I donate my tickets for a tax receipt?</b> 
				</p>
				<p>
					You may donate your tickets, up until the day before the performance that you are unable to attend, for most MCO concerts (some exceptions apply). Please write &lsquo;VOID&rsquo; and &lsquo;DONATE&rsquo; on the tickets you wish to donate and e-mail a photo or copy to info@themco.ca or fax a copy to (204) 783-7383. Be sure to include your contact information (including day/evening phone numbers). We will cancel your tickets and mail you an official income tax receipt for charitable purposes for the value of the tickets.

				<p>
					Season tickets ordered in the spring or summer months for the upcoming season are mailed out from late-August; orders received from then on are processed and mailed immediately.

					<b>Are there any age restrictions at MCO concerts?</b> 
				</p>
				<p>
					Children under the age of 14 should be accompanied by a teacher or other adult. Generally, babes in arms are not allowed, but we won&rsquo;t stop you from bringing any member of the family! That being said, a classical music concert is best enjoyed at a certain level of maturity. Please keep children quiet and seated, and use appropriate intervals for washroom breaks.

The use of recording and photographic equipment is not permitted.
