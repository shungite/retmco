				While the MCO presents many concerts throughout Manitoba, across Canada and abroad, the Orchestra&rsquo;s usual home is in historic Westminster United Church, located at 745 Westminster at Maryland in Winnipeg. With some of the richest acoustics of any venue in the city, Westminster&rsquo;s intimate sanctuary means that every audience member feels like they have the best seat in the house to see some of the world&rsquo;s greatest musicians.

					<b>I&rsquo;m a subscriber. How do I exchange tickets?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					For subscribers, any concert ticket is good at any other show in the same season. All we ask is that you inform us at least 48 hours in advance of concert day that you would like to swap that ticket for another. This allows us to know how many seats we have available for sold out shows. Simply call 204-783-7377 at least two days before the concert. For obvious reasons, we are unable to exchange tickets into a sold-out concert.

					<b>When are season tickets mailed out?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Season tickets ordered in the spring or summer months for the upcoming season are mailed out from late-August; orders received from then on are processed and mailed immediately. If you subscribe close to the date of a concert, or if you have made a request, your tickets may be picked up at the ticket table at any concert.

					<b>Are there any age restrictions at MCO concerts?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Children under the age of 14 should be accompanied by a teacher or other adult. Generally, babes in arms are not allowed, but we won&rsquo;t stop you from bringing any member of the family! That being said, a classical music concert is best enjoyed at a certain level of maturity. Please keep children quiet and seated, and use appropriate intervals for washroom breaks.

These are available on a first-come, first-served basis, so leave a little early for the concert. Also look for parking in the surrounding neighbourhood, but prepare for a bit of a walk!
