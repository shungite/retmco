		<h4>Janina Fialkowska has played<br />a big part in the MCO&rsquo;s 40-year story</h4>
		<p>Some of MCO&rsquo;s guest soloists become more like family, and that definitely includes Canadian pianist Janina Fialkowska. It’s been a while since she has graced our stage, and a fortieth birthday seems like the perfect occasion to get together!</p>
		<p>Fialkowska has been in the news quite a bit lately, both for receiving the Governor General’s Performing Arts Award and with glowing reviews of her new album, Liszt Recital (named album of the week by <em>The Independent</em>). In Gramophone, reviewer Bryce Morrison exclaimed, &ldquo;We need many more records from this master-pianist!&rdquo;</p>
		<p><strong>Lifetime achievement</strong></p>
		<p>Janina Fialkowska received Canada&rsquo;s 2012 &lsquo;Governor General&rsquo;s Performing Arts Award&rsquo; for Lifetime Achievement in Classical Music. Three days of celebration included a reception on Parliament Hill and a private luncheon with the Speaker of the House of Commons.</p>
		<p>At the official ceremony in Rideau Hall, thousands cheered and there were heartfelt contributions from fellow pianist Jackie Parker and from Oscar-winning (friend, cousin and Connecticut neighbour) Christopher Plummer, as well as a very personal and moving tribute from Canadian radio icon and friend Shelagh Rogers.</p>

				<p><strong>Janina Fialkowska</strong></p>
				<p>Beloved worldwide for her exquisite pianism, Janina Fialkowska has enchanted audiences for over thirty years with her glorious lyrical sound, her sterling musicianship and her profound sense of musical integrity. Born in Montréal to a Canadian mother and a Polish father, Janina studied in Montréal, Paris and at Juilliard and her career was launched in 1974 by Arthur Rubinstein after her prize-winning performance at his inaugural Master Piano Competition in Israel. She has since performed with all the foremost US, Canadian, European and Asian orchestras &mdash; many of them numerous times &mdash; working with conductors such as  Sir Georg Solti, Sir Andrew Davis, Bernard Haitink, Lorin Maazel, Zubin Mehta, Stanislaw Skrowaczewski and Klaus Tennstedt.</p>
				<p>Janina Fialkowska has won special recognition for a series of important premieres, most notably the world premiere performance of a newly discovered piano concerto by Liszt with the Chicago Symphony in 1990 and, in 2010, with the Québec Symphony Orchestra the world premiere of the Chopin-inspired piano concerto entitled <em>Prelude Variations</em> by John Burge &mdash; written for and dedicated to Janina. Adding to her already significant discography, in 2010 Ms. Fialkowska released three CDs of Chopin&rsquo;s music, all of which received stellar reviews worldwide. &ldquo;Indeed, lesser mortals may well weep with envy at such unfaltering authority.&rdquo; (Bryce Morrison in Gramophone Magazine about the pianist&rsquo;s double album Chopin: Etudes, Impromptus, Sonatas.)</p>
				<p>Janina Fialkowska was the Founding Director of the hugely successful Piano Six project and its successor, Piano Plus. This latest project brings together some of Canada&rsquo;s greatest classical pianists, instrumentalists and vocalists with Canadians who, for either geographical or financial reasons, would otherwise be unable to hear this calibre of live classical performance. In 2000, Piano Six won a top Canadian Arts award &mdash; the Chalmers.</p>
				<p>In January 2002, at the onset of a major European tour, Ms. Fialkowska&rsquo;s career was brought to a dramatic halt by the discovery of a tumour in her left arm. After successful surgery to remove the cancer, Janina underwent further surgery a year later &mdash; a rare muscle-transfer procedure. After 18 months of performing the Ravel and Prokofiev concertos for Left Hand (which she transcribed for her right hand) she resumed her two-handed career, beginning with a tremendously successful and highly emotional recital held in Germany in January 2004.</p>
				<p>2011 was Liszt&rsquo;s anniversary year and Janina celebrated it on concert stage and on CD. Her latest CD release, Liszt Recital, was hailed as &ldquo;the most beautiful Liszt CD of this decade&rdquo; (Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung). She also shared her Liszt expertise in several master classes around the world, including at her own International Piano Academy in Bavaria and at the Schleswig Holstein Music Festival. Her 2011 performances included her debut with the Radiosinfonieorcester Stuttgart, her Swiss debut with Musikkollegium Winterthur and the opening concert of the international Singapore Piano festival.</p>
				<p>Janina Fialkowska is an Officer of the Order of Canada and holds honorary doctorates from Acadia University and Queen&rsquo;s University. She received the 2012 Governor General&rsquo;s Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Achievement in Classical Music &mdash; Canada&rsquo;s foremost honour for excellence in the performing arts.</p>
				<p><strong>Karen Sunabacka</strong></p>
				<p>Karen Sunabacka&rsquo;s music has been performed in Canada, the US and the United Kingdom. In April 2010 she was the featured composer for the Eckhardt-Gramatté National Music Competition where nine young pianists each performed her commissioned piece Curlicue. Karen won the Canadian Music Centre, Prairie Region, Emerging Composers Competition in February 2009 with her orchestral composition And There Was A Great Calm. </p>
				<p>Karen has also had pieces performed by GroundSwell, the Empyrean Ensemble in Davis (California), the Brandon Chamber Players, Left Coast Ensemble (San Francisco), Agassiz Chamber Players, St. Margaret&rsquo;s Anglican Church Choir (Winnipeg), St. Stephen&rsquo;s Episcopal Church in Belvedere (California) and the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra (reading session) conducted by Maestro Bramwell Tovey.</p>
				<p>As a professor Karen has presented academic papers about women&rsquo;s voices and electroacoustic music all over the world, but most notably in Paris, Los Angeles and across Canada. Her electronic music has been presented at numerous concerts and festivals including: Cellofest at UCDavis, Center for New Music and Audio Technology in Berkeley, Merging Voices: Women in New Music Festival in Fullerton, California and at the Electric Rainbow Coalition, an electronic music festival at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.</p>
				<p>In 2006 Karen won the prestigious UCDavis Outstanding Graduate Student Teaching Award and loves teaching music to students of all ages. Her commitment to teaching has led to many new projects including Summer Arts Camps, composers&rsquo; workshops and community music programs. She has led and directed many canoe trips and finds much of her inspiration from the outdoors.</p>
				<p>Karen was born in Winnipeg in 1975. In March 2008 she graduated from the University of California, Davis with a PhD in Theory and Composition. As a composer, &lsquo;cellist and university professor she is often juggling chamber music performances, composition and a full university teaching load along with a private cello studio. She is the director and founder of the Providence Performing Arts School and she is the Assistant Professor in Music Theory and Composition at Providence University College in Otterburne, Manitoba.</p>
				<p><strong>Gary Kulesha</strong></p>
				<p>Gary Kulesha, who is on Toronto University&rsquo;s Faculty of Music, is one of Canada&rsquo;s most visible musicians. Although principally a composer, he is also active as a pianist, conductor and teacher. His music has been commissioned, performed and recorded by musicians and ensembles the world over. Angels, for marimba and tape, has become a standard repertoire item for percussionists, while his works for Danish recorder virtuoso Michala Petri are toured by her throughout the world each year. Works such as Mysterium Coniunctionis and the Sonata for Horn, Tuba and Piano are performed regularly in Europe and are often taught there as part of performance curricula. Mr. Kulesha&rsquo;s first opera Red Emma, was included in Opera Canada&rsquo;s book of &ldquo;Operas which should be performed more often,&rdquo; beside works by Copland, Bernstein and Weill.</p>
				<p>Gary Kulesha has spent many years as Composer-in-Residence with both the Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony and the Canadian Opera Company and in 1995 was appointed Composer-Advisor to the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. In 2002 he was one of three composers awarded the first National Arts Centre Orchestra Composer Award. This began an extended relationship with the NACO and Pinchas Zukerman, which has included touring with them and writing several works for them.</p>
				<p>An active supporter of young composers and performers, Gary Kulesha was the Artistic Director of The Composers&rsquo; Orchestra from 1987, stepping down in 2004 in favour of three young composers. His conducting activities are extensive and he has premiered hundreds of works. He has guest conducted frequently with major orchestras throughout Canada, and has recorded for radio and CD. Although he is well-known as a specialist in 20th century music his repertoire ranges from little-known Baroque music through to the music of our time. He is currently assisting Toronto Symphony Music Director Peter Oundjian with the design and programming of the TSO&rsquo;s New Creations Festival.</p>
