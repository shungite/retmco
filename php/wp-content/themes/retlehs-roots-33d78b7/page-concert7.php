		<h4>Time machine:<br />hear the first MCO concert ever!</h4>
		<p>After just one concert, Winnipeggers knew that we needed to have live chamber music performed in this town for at least the next forty years.</p>
		<p>Anne Manson: &ldquo;This concert will be an almost exact replica of the first concert MCO ever played, forty years ago. We are so happy to have Tracy Dahl back with us for Britten&rsquo;s Les Illuminations. And the audience will have a chance to get to know Caitlin Broms-Jacobs featured in a Vivaldi oboe concerto.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Roy Goodman, who occupies his own volume in the tome of MCO&rsquo;s history (as Music Director from 2000 to 2005), will once again be at the podium for this happy occasion.</p>
		<p><strong>Maestro Roy Goodman</strong></p>
		<p>Roy Goodman is Principal Guest Conductor of the English Chamber Orchestra, Director Emeritus of the European Union Baroque Orchestra, Honorary President of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra Chorus and has appeared as guest conductor with 120 other orchestras and opera houses.</p>

He has worked as guest conductor with over 120 orchestras and opera companies worldwide &mdash; from Carnegie Hall to the Royal Albert Hall Proms in London; from Berlin Philharmonic Hall to the Sydney Opera House. In 2011 Radio New Zealand affectionately named him the &lsquo;Rafa Nadal&rsquo; of conductors!</p>

				<p>Born in January 1951, Roy Goodman achieved international fame with King&rsquo;s College Choir as the boy soloist in Allegri&rsquo;s <em>Miserere</em> (Decca 1963). Already in 1970 he became a Fellow of the Royal College of Organists, and he completed his studies with a violin performer&rsquo;s ARCM and a music teacher&rsquo;s diploma. In 1979 Goodman was a founder member of Ton Koopman&rsquo;s Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra, then he joined Trevor Pinnock&rsquo;s English Concert, and in 1987 became the first Concertmaster of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment (collaborating with Sir Charles Mackerras, Sir Simon Rattle, Frans Brüggen and Ivan Fischer). Also during the 1980s he directed for CD with the Hanover Band the first ever performances on historic instruments of the complete symphonies by Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann and Weber, as well as 14 symphonies by Mendelssohn and 60 symphonies by Haydn. He has directed over 120 CDs ranging from Monteverdi&rsquo;s sacred vocal music to Holst&rsquo;s Planets, in addition to conducting more than forty world premieres of contemporary music.</p>

				<p><strong>Tracy Dahl</strong></p>
				<p>With her 2006 debut at La Scala as Zerbinetta in <em>Ariadne auf Naxos</em>, Canada&rsquo;s premier coloratura soprano, Tracy Dahl, achieved another milestone in a career that has taken her to the Metropolitan Opera, the San Francisco Opera, the Houston Grand Opera, the Santa Fe Opera, the Canadian Opera Company, and the Châtelet in Paris, to name but a few. Her &ldquo;superlative coloratura&rdquo; (Globe and Mail), is regularly singled out by critics. &ldquo;Her extreme high notes, and she threw in a lot of them, are easy and spectacular&rdquo; (Boston Globe). She has &ldquo;a voice filled with sunshine, rainbows and laser light&rdquo; according to Opera Magazine and the San Francisco Chronicle finds her &ldquo;bright, sparkling, and bouncing, accurate and winning.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where pure, well-tuned, characterful, and seemingly easy acrobatics through two and a half octaves are required, Dahl is among a relative few who can do it all superlatively well,&rdquo; comments the Calgary Herald. In 2009 she was awarded the Opera Canada Award.</p>
				<p>Highlights of 2012 included two trips to Australia with the Melbourne and Sydney symphonies, works by Bach and Mozart with the Vancouver Symphony, and the title role of Maria Stuarda with the Pacific Opera Victoria. During the summer she returned to the Opera Theatre of St. Louis for Unsuk Chin&rsquo;s opera <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> in the role of the Cheshire Cat and sang Gershwin songs with the New York Philharmonic under Bramwell Tovey.</p>
				<p>In season 2010 Dahl portrayed the quirky Violet Beauregard in the world premiere of <em>The Golden Ticket</em> at the Opera Theatre of St. Louis and appeared with the Vancouver Symphony.</p>
				<p>Among her many notable debuts at major opera houses have been as Adele in <em>Die Fledermaus</em> at the Metropolitan Opera (later returning as Zerbinetta and as Florestine in the world premiere and revival productions of <em>The Ghosts of Versailles</em>), as Olympia in the San Francisco Opera production of <em>Les Contes d&rsquo;Hoffmann</em> opposite Plácido Domingo (where she returned as Oscar in <em>Un Ballo in Maschera</em> and Lucia in <em>Lucia di Lammermoor</em>), Amor in the Los Angeles Music Center Opera staging of <em>Orpheus in the Underworld</em>. She was also heard as Despina in <em>Cosí Fan Tutte</em> with the Dallas Opera; and Eurydice in <em>Orpheus in the Underworld</em> with Michigan Opera Theater and Houston Grand Opera, where she also sang Oscar. Dahl was Gretel in <em>Hansel and Gretel</em> with the Cleveland Opera. She appeared as Servilia in New York City Opera&rsquo;s production of <em>La Clemenza di Tito</em>.</p>
				<p>Dahl has performed with every major Canadian orchestra. Other orchestral engagements have included a New Year&rsquo;s Eve Gala concert with the Philadelphia Orchestra under David Zinman and appearances with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra during the Atlanta &lsquo;96 Olympics Arts Festival. Dahl performed with the American Symphony Orchestra in the world premiere of David Del Tredici&rsquo;s <em>Child Alice</em> at Carnegie Hall. She appeared with the San Francisco Symphony in Handel&rsquo;s <em>Messiah</em>, and with the Saint Louis Symphony under Leonard Slatkin. She also performed with maestro Slatkin at the Hollywood Bowl, joined the Tonhalle Orchestra/Zurich under Zinman for a gala New Year&rsquo;s Eve concert, and made her United Kingdom debut with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra.</p>
				<p>Her discography includes <em>A Disney Spectacular</em> with the Cincinnati Pops (Telarc), <em>Glitter and Be Gay</em> with the Calgary Philharmonic (CBC), <em>A Gilbert and Sullivan Gala</em> with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra (CBC), and <em>Love Walked In</em>, a Gershwin collection with the Bramwell Tovey Trio (Red Phone Box Company).</p>
				<p><strong>Caitlin Broms-Jacobs</strong></p>
				<p>Described as &ldquo;a delightfully musical player, with elegant tone and delivery&rdquo; (Winnipeg Free Press), Caitlin Broms-Jacobs is now in her fourth season as principal oboist of the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra. Caitlin enjoys a wide-ranging career of chamber music, recital, orchestral, and solo performances, and performs frequently in Winnipeg and across Canada.  Caitlin has served as guest principal oboist of the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra and was formerly principal oboist of the Saskatoon Symphony Orchestra. She has performed with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, the New World Symphony, the National Ballet Orchestra, and the Pacific Music Festival Orchestra.  Caitlin has, as principal oboist, performed with numerous conductors including Simon Streatfeild, Nello Santi, Yakov Kreizberg, Jun Markl, and Valery Gergiev.</p>
				<p>Caitlin frequently collaborates with composers and performs contemporary music. She has been featured in Winnipeg&rsquo;s GroundSwell series and can be heard broadcast on CBC Radio 2. She enjoys studio recording and has most recently recorded with renowned bass-baritone Victor Engbrecht.</p>
				<p>A native of Toronto, Caitlin studied with Keith Atkinson at the Royal Conservatory of Music&rsquo;s Young Artists Performance Academy. She received her Bachelor of Music degree from the Eastman School of Music where she studied with Richard Killmer. She continued her studies with Chicago Symphony Orchestra principal oboist Eugene Izotov.</p>
				<p><strong>John Estacio</strong></p>
				<p>One of Canada&rsquo;s most frequently performed and broadcast composers, John Estacio has served as Composer-in-Residence for the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Calgary Opera. These residencies yielded several works, many of which can be found on the CD entitled <em>Frenergy, the Music of John Estacio</em>. This CD earned Estacio two JUNO nominations and a Western Canadian Music Award. His frequent performances and broadcasts have earned him several SOCAN Concert Music Awards.</p>
				<p>Estacio is the recent recipient of the National Arts Centre Award for Composers, which will result in three commissioned works for the National Arts Centre Orchestra. His most recent opera, <em>Lillian Alling</em>, premiered in Vancouver in 2010. His first opera, <em>Filumena</em>, has been remounted five times, and was filmed for television.</p>
				<p>In the 2010/11 season, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra gave the Carnegie Hall premiere of <em>Frenergy</em>. The Royal Winnipeg Ballet featured several of Estacio&rsquo;s orchestral works in a new ballet, <em>Wonderland</em>, with choreography by Shawn Hounsell.</p>
				<p>Estacio recently completed a cantata for chorus and orchestra, and a Sinfonietta for the Victoria Symphony. He has also written for the symphony orchestras of Toronto, Montréal and Vancouver, and the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra. His works have been performed by the Houston Symphony, Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra, Fort Wayne Philharmonic, and the Manila Symphony, and his choral work Eulogies has entered the repertoire of several choirs. His arrangements of seven songs by Jean Sibelius were performed by Ben Heppner and the Los Angeles Philharmonic in London and Paris.</p>
				<p>The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation commissioned <em>Such Sweet Sorrow</em> for the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra. The premiere performance was given 7 February 2001 by conductor Roy Goodman and the MCO.</p>
