		<h4>Pianistic might,<br />for mighty music: Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin</h4>
		<p>&ldquo;A one-of-a-kind concert artist ... his rhythms were so exacting and his touch so subtle that each note seemed to have a life of its own.&rdquo; So says the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>. We knew that!</p>
		<p>Piano star Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin has appeared with the MCO four times over the years; we always want him back and, happily, he always wants to return to Winnipeg and our stage!</p>
		<p>Hamelin is equally at home with traditional and contemporary repertoire as we&rsquo;ll see on this concert. Shostakovich virtually invented the piano concerto anew when he first penned this razor-sharp and minimalist work in 1933, and we can&rsquo;t wait to hear the work in Hamelin&rsquo;s hands.</p>
		<p>For the first time ever we&rsquo;ll present a work by American composer Dorothy Chang. Described as &ldquo;evocative and kaleidoscopic&rdquo; by the <em>Seattle Times</em>, her music is characterized by an emphasis on dramatic intensity and expressive lyricism.</p>

				<p><strong>Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin</strong></p>
				<p>Pianist Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin&rsquo;s unique blend of musicianship and virtuosity brings forth interpretations remarkable for their freedom, originality and prodigious mastery of the piano&rsquo;s resources. A musician of broad musical interests and curiosity, Hamelin is renowned in equal measure for his fresh readings of the established repertoire and for his exploration of lesser known works of the 19th and 20th centuries, both in the recording studio and in the concert hall.</p>
				<p>This season Hamelin performs Haydn piano concerti with Les Violons du Roy and Bernard Labadie (which will be recorded for release on Hyperion), Beethoven&rsquo;s Piano Concerto No. 4 with the Tonhalle-Orchester Zurich and David Zinman, the Atlanta Symphony and Hugh Wolff, and the National Arts Centre in Ottawa led by Ainars Ribikis. He joins the National Philharmonic of Russia and Vladimir Spivakov for concerti by Rubinstein and Medtner, appears with the San Francisco Symphony with David Robertson playing Ravel and Gershwin &mdash; and also performs with the Columbus Symphony and the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra. Mr. Hamelin will tour Canada and the US performing the Shostakovich Piano Quintet with the Takacs String Quartet and will appear in recital in cities including New York (where he will perform the premiere in that city of his Variations on a Theme by Paganini), Chicago, Vancouver, London, Berlin, Lisbon, Munich, Stuttgart, Moscow and Antwerp.</p>
				<p>During the summer of 2012 Marc-Andr&eacute; opened the Aspen Music Festival season with Robert Spano leading the orchestra in Gershwin&rsquo;s Rhapsody in Blue and returned in recital. He also performed in Seattle, Montr&eacute;al, Aix-en-Provence and in Helsingborg, where, in conjunction with serving on the jury of the Edvard Grieg Piano Competition, he performed a recital at Grieg&rsquo;s home, Troldhaugen. In 2012 he opened the season at the BBC Proms with a late night recital of Liszt works and with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. He debuted with Berliner Philharmoniker and appeared with other major symphony European orchestras. In North America, he performed with the orchestras of Chicago, Montr&eacute;al, Qu&eacute;bec and Seattle. He also performed the epic Busoni Piano Concerto throughout the season both in Europe and North America.  In recent seasons, Hamelin has performed with orchestra and in solo recital at the Lincoln Center, the various stages of Carnegie Hall and on an international tour of the Schumann Piano Quintet with the Takacs Quartet. </p>
				<p>Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin records exclusively for Hyperion Records. His most recent releases include Reger and Strauss concerti with the Runfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin and a solo disc of works by Liszt; the latter was selected by Bryce Morrison for Gramophone&rsquo;s 2011 &lsquo;Critics&rsquo; Choice&rsquo; feature. An album of his own compositions, <em>Hamelin: Etudes</em>, received a 2010 Grammy nomination (his ninth) and a first prize from the German Record Critics&rsquo; Association. His discography includes concertos and works for solo piano by composers such as Alkan, Busoni, Godowsky and Medtner, as well as brilliantly received performances of Brahms, Chopin, Haydn, Liszt and Schumann.</p>
				<p>A resident of Boston Marc-Andr&eacute; Hamelin is the recipient of a lifetime achievement prize by the German Record Critics&rsquo; Association and is an Officer of the Order of Canada, a Chevalier de l&rsquo;Ordre du Qu&eacute;bec, and a member of the Royal Society of Canada.</p>
				<p><strong>Dorothy Chang</strong></p>
				<p>Described as “evocative and kaleidoscopic” (<em>Seattle Times</em>), the music of Dorothy Chang is characterized by an emphasis on dramatic intensity and expressive lyricism, with a more recent interest in interdisciplinary works involving video, imagery and movement.</p>
				<p>Her music has been performed by orchestras including the Albany (NY) Symphony, Aspen Concert Orchestra, Chicago Civic Orchestra, Indianapolis Symphony, Queens Symphony, Seattle Symphony, Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, Vancouver Island and Vancouver Symphony, as well as by chamber ensembles including eighth blackbird, the Smith Quartet (UK), the Chicago Saxophone Quartet, Collage New Music (Boston), North/South Consonance (New York), Music from China, and Soundstreams (Toronto). It has been featured in concerts and festivals across North America and abroad, most recently at the PAN Music Festival (Seoul), Lontano Festival (UK), and World Music Days in Hong Kong.</p>
				<p>Awards and honours that Dorothy has received include a Charles Ives Scholarship from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, awards from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, the International Alliance for Women in Music, Mu Phi Epsilon, the National Society of Arts and Letters, Meet the Composer and the Jacob Druckman Orchestra Prize from the Aspen Music Festival. She has received commissions from the Canada Council of the Arts, the British Columbia Arts Council, the Barlow Endowment, Chamber Music America, and the Mary Flagler Cary Charitable Trust.  For the 2003/04 and 2005–08 seasons, Dorothy held a Music Alive composer residency with the Albany Symphony Orchestra.</p>
				<p>In 2008, she was awarded the inaugural commission from the Women&rsquo;s Philharmonic Commissioning Project of Meet the Composer, for a new orchestral work, Strange Air, which was premiered at the Cabrillo Festival  of Contemporary Music by conductor Marin Alsop and the festival orchestra.</p>
				<p>Born in Winfield, Illinois, Dorothy began her music studies on piano at age six, and began composing at the age of fourteen. She received degrees in composition from the University of Michigan (B.M., M.M.) and the Indiana University School of Music (D.M). She has served on the music faculty at Indiana State University, and is currently Associate Professor of Music at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.</p>
				<p><strong>Jos&eacute; Evangelista</strong></p>
				<p>Jos&eacute; Evangelista pursues an artistic path by which he has explored ways of making a music based exclusively on melody. Hence, he has developed a heterophonic writing, both for instruments and orchestra, in which the melodic line generates echoes of itself and creates an illusion of polyphony. His music draws its roots from an enlarged vision of tradition: to his Spanish origins he has added the influences of the Indonesian gamelan, the Western avant-garde and modal music.</p>
				<p>Evangelista was born in Valencia, Spain, in 1943. He began his musical studies with Vicente Asencio while simultaneously studying physics. Later work in computers led him to Canada. Settling in Montr&eacute;al in 1970, he studied composition with Andr&eacute; Pr&eacute;vost and Bruce Mather. From 1979 to 2009 he was a professor at the University of Montr&eacute;al, where he created the Balinese Gamelan Workshop in 1987. He has been a founding member of several concert societies, has received a number of awards, and commissions from, among others, Itin&eacute;raire (Paris), the Kronos Quartet, the Groupe vocal de France, SMCQ and the CBC. His works have been performed in Canada, the US, Europe, Asia and Australia by groups such as Ensemble Modern (Frankfurt), the Nieuw Ensemble (Amsterdam), Music Projects (London), the Orchestre philharmonique de Radio-France, the Montr&eacute;al Symphony Orchestra, I Musici de Montr&eacute;al, Esprit Orchestra and the Nouvel Ensemble Moderne (Montr&eacute;al). Between 1993 and 1995 he was composer-in-residence with the Montr&eacute;al Symphony Orchestra. He has premiered two operas: Exercices de conversation (Lyon 2000, libretto by Eugène Ionesco) and Manuscrit trouv&eacute; à Saragosse (Montr&eacute;al 2001, libretto by Alexis Nouss after Jan Potocki). Recent compositions include a concerto for the Montr&eacute;al cellist, Velitchka Yotcheva, and a piece for guitarist David Russell. He is also writing a book on heterophony.</p>
